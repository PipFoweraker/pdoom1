# Bug Sweep Critical Stability Session

## Overview

Systematic bug sweep session targeting 4 high-priority GitHub issues. Discovered most issues were already resolved in previous sessions, with key focus on fixing a critical debug console crash that was causing test suite failures.

## Technical Changes

### Core Improvements
- Fixed fatal access violation crash in debug console UI component
- Enhanced font initialization safety checks in UI rendering
- Updated test expectations to match current menu implementation

### Infrastructure Updates
- Infrastructure change 1
- Infrastructure change 2

## Impact Assessment

### Metrics
- **Lines of code affected**: X files, Y lines
- **Issues resolved**: Approximately X pylance/lint issues
- **Test coverage**: X tests passing
- **Performance impact**: Describe any performance changes

### Before/After Comparison
**Before:**
- Previous state description

**After:**  
- New state description

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
