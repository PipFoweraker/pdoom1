# ResearchSystemManager Extraction - 5th Major Module

## Overview

Successfully completed the 5th major module extraction from the P(Doom) monolith, creating a comprehensive ResearchSystemManager that isolates all research quality management, technical debt operations, researcher assignments, and debt dialog functionality. This 610-line extraction continues the systematic modular architecture transformation.

## Technical Changes

### Core Improvements
- ResearchSystemManager created with 610 lines of focused functionality
- game_state.py reduced from 5,432 to 5,399 lines (886 total reduction from original)
- Clean delegation pattern established for all research methods
- Zero regressions maintained through systematic testing

### Architecture Milestones
- 5th major module extraction completed successfully
- Total extracted: 2,120 lines across 5 focused modules  
- Monolith reduction: 14.1% improvement achieved
- Proven extraction methodology validated again

## Impact Assessment

### Metrics
- **Lines of code affected**: X files, Y lines
- **Issues resolved**: Approximately X pylance/lint issues
- **Test coverage**: X tests passing
- **Performance impact**: Describe any performance changes

### Before/After Comparison
**Before:**
- Previous state description

**After:**  
- New state description

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
Describe the systematic approach used.

### Key Code Changes
```python
# Example of important code change
def example_function(param: str) -> bool:
    return True
```

### Testing Strategy
How the changes were validated.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate priorities**
   - Next task 1
   - Next task 2

2. **Medium-term goals**
   - Longer-term objective 1
   - Longer-term objective 2

## Lessons Learned
