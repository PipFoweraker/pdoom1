        "comment": """Resolved by Godot UI migration (#COMMIT_HASH).

**What was done:**
- Implemented comprehensive keyboard navigation across all screens
- Arrow keys for navigation (↑↓ or WS)
- Enter/Space for selection
- Escape for back/cancel
- Number keys (1-9) for direct selection in welcome screen
- Keyboard shortcuts in all new menus (Settings, Pre-Game Setup, Player Guide)

**Screens with keyboard navigation:**
- Welcome Screen: Full keyboard navigation with visual focus
- Settings Menu: Keyboard shortcuts (Escape to back)
- Pre-Game Setup: Enter to launch, Escape to cancel
- Player Guide: Escape to back
- End Game Screen: R to replay, Escape to menu

All navigation is consistent and follows expected patterns. Tests would need updating for pygame → Godot transition."""

        "title": "Enhancement: Advanced Menu Consolidation",
        "comment": """Partially addressed by Godot UI migration (#COMMIT_HASH).

**What was implemented:**
- Settings Menu consolidation (Audio, Graphics, Gameplay in one screen)
- Pre-Game Setup consolidation (all game config in one place)
- Removed scattered menu options

**Godot-specific approach:**
Rather than submenus within the game, we created dedicated screens:
- Settings Menu: All configuration options consolidated
- Pre-Game Setup: Player name, lab name, seed, difficulty together
- Player Guide: Comprehensive tutorial in one place

This achieves the same goal (cleaner UI, better organization) with Godot's scene-based architecture. The in-game action consolidation would be a separate issue for the main game UI."""

The Godot migration focused on:
- Welcome/main menu screens
- Settings menu
- Pre-game setup
- Player guide
- End game screen

The fundraising submenu expansion would be part of the main game UI (main_ui.gd), not the menu system. This issue should remain for future work on the in-game action system."""

**What was done:**
- Enhanced end game screen with victory/defeat celebration
- Proper color coding for victory (green) vs defeat (red)
- New record highlighting with gold color
- Additional stats display (P(Doom), papers published)
- Keyboard shortcuts (R to replay, Escape to menu)
- Proper navigation back to welcome screen

The end game screen now has proper state transitions and enhanced display. Test expectations for pygame would need updating for the new Godot implementation."""
