#### 2. Employee Productivity System
**Files**: `godot/scripts/core/turn_manager.gd`, `godot/scripts/core/game_state.gd` (+80 lines)

**Mechanics Implemented**:
- Management capacity (9 employees per manager, base 9 before first manager)
- Compute distribution (1 compute per productive employee)
- Research generation (30% chance, 1-3 points per productive employee)
- Compute engineer bonus (+10% per engineer)
- Safety researcher passive (-0.3 doom per turn if productive)
- Capability researcher penalty (+0.5 doom per turn always)
- Unproductivity doom penalty (+0.5 per unproductive employee)

**New State Functions**:
```gdscript
func get_management_capacity() -> int
func get_unmanaged_count() -> int
```

#### 3. Manager Hiring System
**Files**: `godot/scripts/core/actions.gd`, `godot/scripts/core/game_state.gd` (+30 lines)

**New Employee Type**: Manager
- Cost: $80,000 + 1 AP
- Oversees: 9 employees
- Always productive (doesn't consume compute)
- Prevents unproductivity doom spiral

#### 4. Enhanced Events System
**File**: `godot/scripts/core/events.gd` (+120 lines)

**New Events**:
- Employee Burnout (5+ safety researchers)
- Rival Lab Poaching (random, 8%, turn 10+)
- Media Scandal (random, 6%, turn 7+)
- Government Regulation (doom >= 60, one-time)
- Technical Failure (random, 5%, turn 12+)

**Enhanced Condition Evaluation**:
- Added staff condition support (safety_researchers, managers, etc.)
- Threshold triggers now work with all state variables

#### 5. Rival AI Labs System
**File**: `godot/scripts/core/rivals.gd` (NEW FILE, +140 lines)

**3 Rival Labs**:
- **DeepSafety**: $500k funding, 0.3 aggression (safety-focused)
- **CapabiliCorp**: $1M funding, 0.9 aggression (capabilities-focused)
- **StealthAI**: $300k funding, 0.5 aggression (balanced)

**Autonomous Actions**:
- 1-3 actions per turn based on funding
- Actions: hire_researcher, buy_compute, publish_paper, fundraise, capability_research, safety_research
- Doom contributions: -10 to +20 per turn
- Deterministic (seeded RNG)

**Integration**:
- Rivals act during turn end
- Doom contributions visible in turn summary
- Rival summaries in game state dict

#### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: `godot/tests/test_phase5_features.gd` (NEW FILE, +110 lines)

**9 Test Cases**:
- Expanded actions verification
- Manager system capacity calculations
- Employee productivity mechanics
- Rival lab initialization
- Rival actions affect doom
- Expanded events exist
- Event condition evaluation with staff
- Full turn integration test

## üéØ Design Principles Applied

1. **Native Over Bridge**: Godot-first architecture for simplicity
2. **Strategic Depth**: Multiple viable approaches to victory
3. **Meaningful Choices**: Actions have clear tradeoffs
4. **Resource Tension**: Limited money, compute, AP, reputation
5. **Time Pressure**: Rivals create urgency
6. **Clear Feedback**: Warnings for unproductivity, turn summaries
7. **Deterministic**: Seeded RNG for reproducibility

## üìà Balance Overview

**Starting Resources**:
- Money: $100,000
- Compute: 100
- Doom: 50%
- Action Points: 3

**Key Costs**:
- Researcher: $50-60k
- Manager: $80k
- Compute: $50k for 50
- Maintenance: $5k per employee per turn

**Doom Rates**:
- Base: +1.0/turn
- Per capability researcher: +0.5/turn
- Per unproductive employee: +0.5/turn
- Per safety researcher: -0.3/turn (if productive)
- Rivals: -10 to +20/turn

**Game Length**: Balanced for 15-20 turns

## üöÄ Next Steps (Phase 6 Suggestions)

### Critical UX Improvements
1. **Employee productivity visual feedback** - Show who's productive/unproductive and why
2. **Action affordability highlighting** - Green/yellow/red color coding
3. **Rival lab progress display** - Visible competitor status
4. **Turn summary screen** - Clear breakdown of doom changes
5. **Resource warning thresholds** - Alert when money/compute low

### Gameplay Refinements
- Action recommendation system (AI suggestions)
- Difficulty settings (easy/normal/hard)
- Scenario system (preset challenges)
- Achievements tracking
- End game statistics screen

### Polish
- Keyboard shortcuts

## üí° Key Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Native Godot approach**: Much simpler than bridge
- **Python prototype as reference**: Good balance formulas to adapt
- **Modular design**: Easy to extend (actions, events, rivals)
- **Comprehensive docs**: Player guide + developer reference

### Design Decisions
- **Managers as employee type** vs complex management system: Simpler, clear mechanic
- **Fixed 9-employee capacity** vs variable: Easier to understand
- **3 rival labs** vs more: Right balance of variety without clutter
- **30% research chance** vs guaranteed: Adds variance, prevents predictability

### Risks Addressed
- **Balance**: Based on proven Python formulas, should be playable
- **Complexity**: Documentation explains all systems clearly
- **Testing**: Test suite covers critical mechanics
- **UX**: Phase 6 suggestions prioritize critical feedback

## üéÆ How to Play (Quick Start)

1. Hire 2-3 safety researchers
2. Buy compute (need 1 per employee)
3. End turn ‚Üí Employees generate research
4. **At 9 employees: HIRE MANAGER** (critical!)
5. Keep hiring, maintain compute, hire managers as needed
6. React to events (fundraising, recruitment opportunities)
7. Use strategic actions (lobby, grants, warnings)
8. Watch rival labs (respond to CapabiliCorp aggression)
9. Race to doom = 0%

**Common Mistake**: Hiring too fast without compute/managers ‚Üí Unproductivity doom spiral!
