## 🚀 Usage Examples

### For Players
```
Press '1' to execute "Grow Community"
Press '2' to execute "Fundraise"
Press '3' to execute "Safety Research"
... and so on for actions 1-9

Listen for satisfying "ding" sound when spending AP
Watch AP counter glow yellow when Action Points are spent
Notice action buttons gray out when AP is insufficient
```

### For Developers
```python
# Execute action via keyboard shortcut
success = game_state.execute_action_by_keyboard(action_index)

# Play AP spend sound on success
if success:
    game_state.sound_manager.play_ap_spend_sound()

# Calculate safe blob position
x, y = game_state._calculate_blob_position(blob_index, screen_w, screen_h)
```

## 📊 Impact Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: +14 new tests (5% increase)
- **User Experience**: Direct keyboard access to all primary actions
- **Visual Polish**: Enhanced feedback for all AP-related interactions
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive documentation and protocols
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support

## 4. Batch 1 Stability & UI Correctness Improvements

**Implementation Date:** 2024 - Issues #122, #118, #121, #52, #131

### Navigation / Back Button Improvements

**Functionality:**
- Fixed back button visibility rule: now shows at navigation depth >= 1 (previously > 1)
- New `should_show_back_button(depth: int) -> bool` helper function for clarity
- Proper navigation state management with push/pop operations
- Enhanced keyboard and mouse navigation support

**Visual Integration:**
- Back button renders in top-left corner with appropriate styling
- Consistent positioning and scaling across screen sizes
- Clear "← Back" indicator with hover effects

**Issues Addressed:**
- Closes #122: Back functionality now available at depth 1
- Closes #118: Duplicate back button issue resolved with centralized helper
- Improved user navigation experience with predictable back button behavior

### UI Overlap Prevention System

**Smart Overlay Positioning:**
- New `get_ui_safe_zones(w, h)` function defines interactive area protection
- `find_safe_overlay_position()` implements first-fit positioning algorithm
- Protected areas include:
  - Resource header (top bar with money, staff, reputation)
  - Action buttons area (left side)
  - Upgrade area (right side) 
  - Event log area (bottom left)
  - End turn button area (bottom right)

**Positioning Algorithm:**
- Prioritizes gap between action and upgrade areas (x=280-520)
- Falls back to minimal intersection positioning when no safe space available
- Maintains overlay visibility within screen bounds
- Scales appropriately for different screen sizes

**Issues Addressed:**
- Fixes #121: Overlay panels no longer obscure core interactive areas
- Provides foundation for future drag capability
- Enhanced user experience with clear UI separation

### Accounting Software Verification

**Balance Change Tracking:**
- Verified correct implementation of `last_balance_change` in `GameState._add()`
- Proper conditional tracking only when accounting software is purchased
- Accurate sign preservation for positive/negative transactions
- Sequential transaction handling (tracks most recent change only)

**UI Display:**
- Green color (100, 255, 100) for positive/zero balance changes
- Red color (255, 100, 100) for negative balance changes
- Proper formatting with "+" prefix for positive amounts
- Integration with existing money display system

**Issues Addressed:**
- Fixes #52: Accounting software now correctly tracks and displays balance changes
- Enhanced financial transparency for players
- Proper visual feedback for monetary transactions

### Test Coverage & Regression Prevention
