## About the Game

You run an underfunded AI safety lab racing against well-resourced competitors to solve the alignment problem. Make strategic decisions about hiring, research priorities, and resource allocation. Your choices determine whether P(Doom) reaches 0% or humanity faces extinction.

**Gameplay:**
- Hire safety researchers or capabilities researchers
- Balance research progress against existential risk
- Manage limited compute, funding, and reputation
- Respond to rival lab actions and random events
- Survive 100 turns with P(Doom) at 0%
