# P(Doom): Bureaucracy Strategy Game

A satirical meta-strategy game about AI Safety, inspired by *Papers, Please*, *Pandemic*, and clicker games.

**Current Version:** See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for latest release information and version history.

WARNING
This is Buggy As Shit.  If you are not using exactly whatever kludge windows python bash default install I am using, this might not even work or will be unexpectedly ugly. Expect bugs, expect failure. If you are here and reading this, you got in early, cool beans. Stable build coming after unstable 0.1.1 release for early alpha and to maybe point hapless game  playing agents at.

**AttributeError crashes on startup (Fixed):**
- If you encounter `AttributeError: 'OnboardingSystem' object has no attribute 'get_mechanic_help'`, update to the latest version
- This critical launch crash has been fixed by implementing the missing method
- The fix includes comprehensive help content for core game mechanics

**Missing pygame module:**
```sh
pip install pygame
```

**Black screen or UI not responding:**

```
This validates that all systems are working properly, including the enhanced settings and configuration features.

**Enhanced settings demonstration:**
```sh
python demo_settings.py
```
Interactive demo of the new settings menu system and game configuration features.

**Full test suite (recommended for developers):**
```sh
# Run all tests (should show ~507 tests passing, takes about 38 seconds)
python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

**Important**: Always run tests before deploying changes. Tests are automatically run in the deployment pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

If tests fail, check your Python and pygame installation.
