# Improve UI such that it more closely resembles Starcraft 2 in functionality if not aesthetic\n\nThe game's UI needs a little bit of decluttering. 

In any mode where the tutorial is not selected, we don't need the full text descriptors in boxes like we have right now. Instead I want to maximise the amount of real estate in the middle of the screen.

In those instances, let's go for something more like boxes with representative icons. We can use placeholders for now that will be replaced with icons or visual assets or whatever. These can be arranged with a small indicator of the shortcut key in the top right such that players can click on the button but also know what keybopard is mapped to it. 

Let's arrange the keymappings to be set a certain way by default, but then have a menu option somewhre to relog the keybinds and have those changes be persistent. Store this information locally in a way that is correctly ignore by git etc.

Attached are some visual references for how this can be done in visually distinct ways.
