# (enhancement) office cat\n\nIssue description:

Conditional on the players having had 5 employees for 5 turns or more, and some money, (default $666 for health insurance and eworming o $89 for immunizations) the player can adopt a demonic cat that wanders into their office as an event on meeting trigger conditions, they can get an office cat. This has small upkeep costs but is net positive for morale. A cute cat will curl up somewhere graphically and snooze in an adorable fashion. The cat can be petted at any time which generates a small, transient love emoji.


Upkeep costs are: remebering 1 tick = 1 week - cat food is $1.25 per can, a cat eats 1 can of food and 36 grams of dry food at a cost per serve of dry food of 0.80c per day.

these are tracked as numbers becausee it's funny for end game stats. as an easter egg plus future achievement unlocks

The cat asset will also be used in lieu of something like the doom palyer's increasingly bloodied face. Instead, the power of your creativity plus searching things like 'doomy cat' and 'cat with laser eyes' will come up with stages of increasingly funny but dire 'doominess' for this cat as a visual representation of the increasing doom meter. When the game ends, perhaps the cats eyes flash dramatically and effect the lightinf of the screen or something. Maybe each stage can have a visual indicator like the sky filling with clouds or colours shifting ominously.  Have fun with this. 

This is all in tribute to a cat of the devlopers (who is alive and happy) but is the manifestation of doom thematiclaly for the company until we secure rights to a shoggoth.

Build out a stub or iterative versions of this, you can use super cartoonish effects for now, UI will fix later.

I have attached image as an attachedmt to this can find in comments, delegating to copilot

(Hey, can you please create a branch and a PR etc to solve this as its own  special little side quest as it is emotionally important but not critical to the game, thanks, best efforts are fine - use the image attached by searching carefully and logginng it in the assets section and making copies that you fiddle with etc to follow good dev practise. )\n\n<!-- GitHub Issue #184 -->
