# Enhancement: Technical Debt Visualization System

**Priority**: Medium-High  
**Epic**: Research & Quality Systems  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 sessions

## Overview
Implement comprehensive UI visualization for the technical debt system introduced in v0.4.0, providing players clear feedback on research quality decisions and long-term project health.

## Current State
- Technical debt system exists in game logic (Rush Research adds debt, Quality Research reduces debt)
- No player-facing visualization of debt levels or impact
- Limited feedback on the consequences of research quality choices

## Proposed Features

### 1. Technical Debt Meter
- **Visual Indicator**: Progress bar or meter showing current technical debt level
- **Color Coding**: Green (low debt) -> Yellow (moderate) -> Red (high debt)
- **Placement**: Integrate into main UI resource panel alongside money, doom, reputation
- **Tooltips**: Hover details explaining current debt impact

### 2. Research Project Tracking
- **Active Projects Panel**: Show ongoing research initiatives with quality indicators
- **Project History**: Track completed research with quality ratings
- **Debt Attribution**: Show which projects contributed to current technical debt
- **Visual Timeline**: Research progress and quality decisions over time

### 3. Debt Impact Visualization
- **Performance Penalties**: Show how technical debt affects research effectiveness
- **Risk Indicators**: Visual warnings when debt levels become problematic
- **Compound Effects**: Illustrate how debt accumulates and impacts future work
- **Recovery Pathways**: Highlight available debt reduction options

### 4. Strategic Planning Tools
- **Debt Projection**: Preview technical debt changes from proposed research actions
- **Quality Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of research approach impacts
- **Optimization Hints**: Suggest optimal research strategies based on current debt
- **Long-term Planning**: Show projected outcomes of different research approaches

## Technical Implementation

### UI Integration Points
- **Main Resource Panel**: Add technical debt meter alongside existing resources
- **Research Dialog Enhancement**: Show debt impact for each research option
- **Activity Log Integration**: Enhanced messages for debt-related events
- **Tooltip System**: Detailed explanations accessible via hover/right-click

### Data Visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Debt meter updates immediately as research completes
- **Historical Tracking**: Store and display debt level changes over time
- **Trend Analysis**: Show debt trajectory and warn of concerning trends
- **Comparative Metrics**: Compare current debt to game averages or optimal levels

### Enhanced Research Dialog
- **Debt Impact Preview**: Show projected debt change for each research option
- **Risk Assessment**: Visual indicators for high-debt research choices
- **Debt Recovery Options**: Highlight Quality Research when debt is high
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions for research approach

## User Experience Goals

### Immediate Feedback
- Players instantly understand the consequences of research quality choices
- Clear visual connection between rushed research and long-term problems
- Obvious pathways for debt recovery and quality improvement

### Strategic Depth  
- Technical debt becomes a meaningful strategic consideration
- Players balance short-term research speed against long-term project health
- Quality Research becomes an obviously valuable investment when debt is high

### Educational Value
- System teaches players about real-world software development trade-offs
- Illustrates the importance of methodical research and quality processes
- Shows compound effects of technical decisions over time

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Debt Meter
- Add technical debt resource to main UI
- Basic color-coded progress bar
- Simple tooltips with current debt level

### Phase 2: Research Dialog Integration  
- Show debt impact in Research Options dialog
- Visual indicators for debt-increasing/reducing research
- Preview projected debt changes

### Phase 3: Advanced Visualization
- Research project tracking panel
- Historical debt trend visualization
- Strategic planning and optimization tools

### Phase 4: Polish & Enhancement
- Smooth animations for debt changes
- Advanced tooltips with detailed explanations
- Integration with achievement and milestone systems

## Success Metrics
- Increased usage of Quality Research when technical debt is high
- Players making informed trade-offs between research speed and quality
- Reduced confusion about research system mechanics
- Positive player feedback on system clarity and strategic depth

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering of debt visualization elements
- **Accessibility**: Color-blind friendly visualization with text alternatives
- **Responsive Design**: Debt meter adapts to different screen sizes
- **Data Persistence**: Technical debt data saved/loaded with game state

## Future Extensions
- **Team Morale Impact**: Technical debt affects staff happiness and productivity
- **Investor Concerns**: High technical debt impacts funding opportunities
- **Competitor Analysis**: Compare your technical debt to AI lab opponents
- **Research Automation**: Technical debt affects the effectiveness of automated research tools
