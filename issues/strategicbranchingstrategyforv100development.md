# Strategic Branching Strategy for v1.0.0 Development\n\nImplementation of 3-phase branching strategy to systematically address critical issues and prepare for v1.0.0 release.

## Overview
Created focused branches for:
- Phase 1: Critical stability fixes (test segfault, sound system, menu system, config consistency)
- Phase 2: Quick wins (leaderboard activation, logging system, branch consolidation) 
- Phase 3: Architecture prep (type annotations, UI refactoring, post-1.0.0 planning)

## Branch Structure
- 11 new strategic branches created
- Legacy branch consolidation planned
- Clear merge strategy and success criteria defined

## Documentation
- Complete strategy documented in docs/STRATEGIC_BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md
- Branch lifecycle management defined
- Risk management protocols established

## Next Actions
- Start with fix/test-suite-segfault (critical blocker)
- Systematic progression through phases
- Regular integration and branch cleanup
