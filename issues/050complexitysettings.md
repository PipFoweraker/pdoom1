# (0.5.0) complexity settings\n\nDesigning for specifications should give you a solid foundation for implementation! We want systems as we add them to

Work independently - you can implement them one at a time
Scale with complexity - simple versions for casual players, full versions for strategy enthusiasts
Integrate naturally - they enhance each other when combined but don't break if others are disabled
Match your existing architecture - they build on your current resource management and event systems

The modular approach means you could even let players toggle individual systems on/off in settings, creating their own difficulty curve. 

For example:

Casual Mode: Basic versions of all systems
Strategic Mode: Standard versions with most mechanics active
Expert Mode: Full complexity with all advanced options
Custom Mode: Players pick and choose which systems to enable

Each specification should include clear integration points with your existing systems (events, resources, competitors) and specific UI requirements to help with implementation planning.

Create a system that allows player choice during game setup phase between the 4 modes above, and either create scaled values or placeholders for manual review and game balancing options as part of solving for this issue.\n\n<!-- GitHub Issue #196 -->
