## Overview
This initiative removes Python 3.8 support and requires Python 3.9+ minimum to address compatibility issues with newer dependencies.

## Progress
-  Code changes completed in PR #223
-  Documentation updated
-  CI/CD workflows updated  
-  Technical debt documented (8 issues created)
-  Awaiting PR merge approval

## Related Issues
Technical debt identified and documented:
- #224 Tutorial System State Management Issues
- #225 Configuration System Import Failures  
- #226 Sound System Default Configuration Issues
- #227 Action Points System Validation Issues
- #228 UI Navigation and Keyboard Shortcuts Issues
- #229 Public Opinion System Logic Issues

## Next Steps
1. Merge PR #223 (with documented technical debt)
2. Address technical debt issues systematically
3. Validate Python 3.9+ compatibility in production

## Impact
- **Breaking Change**: Requires Python 3.9+
- **Version**: 0.2.3 (hotfix candidate)
- **Dependencies**: Future dependency updates no longer constrained by Python 3.8\n\n<!-- GitHub Issue #232 -->
