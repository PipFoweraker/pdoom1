# (0.3) Enhancement - improve welcome and exit terminal messages\n\nWhile the game is in alpha and beta, we can be slightly more verbose with the opening and closing terminal messages.
Things that will be handy would be:
current version of the game
last stable release of the gamme (currently none lol)
Values in default config


things after the game
reason for game exit (crash / graceful crash / player exited from within game /  player exited from main menu
link to log
medium verbose description of end of game state if game ended
medium verbose description of, say, last 10 actions by player if game crashed or graceful crashed\n\n<!-- GitHub Issue #239 -->
