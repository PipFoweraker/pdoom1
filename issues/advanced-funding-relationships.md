# Enhancement: Advanced Funding Relationship System

**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: Economic & Funding Systems  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 sessions

## Overview
Build on the v0.4.0 fundraising dialog system to create persistent investor relationships, funding history tracking, and strategic long-term funding management.

## Current State (v0.4.0)
- Four fundraising options with different risk/reward profiles
- One-time funding actions without persistent consequences
- No relationship tracking with funding sources
- Limited strategic depth in funding decisions

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Investor Relationship Tracking
- **Relationship Levels**: Track standing with VCs, government, strategic partners, etc.
- **Funding History**: Record previous funding rounds, amounts, and outcomes
- **Reputation Impact**: Funding performance affects future availability and terms
- **Relationship Events**: Positive/negative events that impact investor relations

### 2. Funding Terms & Consequences  
- **Equity Dilution**: Large funding rounds reduce player control
- **Board Composition**: Investors gain board seats and influence decisions
- **Milestone Requirements**: Funding comes with performance expectations
- **Exit Pressure**: Investors eventually want returns (IPO, acquisition, etc.)

### 3. Strategic Funding Pipeline
- **Multi-Round Planning**: Series A, B, C progression with increasing complexity
- **Investor Matching**: Different investors appropriate for different growth stages
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Funding success affects opponent lab resources
- **Market Conditions**: Economic cycles impact funding availability and terms

### 4. Advanced Funding Options
- **Convertible Notes**: Bridge funding with equity conversion later
- **Revenue-Based Financing**: Funding repaid from future revenues
- **Strategic Acquisitions**: Partial acquisition by tech giants with strategic benefits
- **IPO Preparation**: Public offering as major late-game funding event

## Gameplay Integration

### Enhanced Funding Dialog
- **Relationship Status**: Show current standing with each investor type
- **Terms Preview**: Display equity dilution, board seat implications, milestone requirements
- **Historical Context**: Show previous funding performance and investor confidence
- **Long-term Impact**: Preview how current funding affects future options

### Board Management System
- **Board Composition**: Track board seats held by different investor groups
- **Board Decisions**: Quarterly board meetings with strategic decisions
- **Investor Alignment**: Balance different investor priorities and expectations
- **Control Mechanics**: Player autonomy decreases as equity dilutes

### Funding Performance Tracking
- **Milestone Achievement**: Track performance against investor expectations
- **Valuation Growth**: Company valuation increases with successful milestones
- **Investor Confidence**: Performance history affects future funding terms
- **Reputation System**: Funding track record impacts all investor relationships

## Strategic Depth

### Multi-Round Planning
- **Growth Strategy**: Different funding strategies for different growth phases
- **Investor Selection**: Choose investors based on strategic value, not just money
- **Exit Strategy**: Plan for eventual investor returns through IPO or acquisition
- **Control vs Capital**: Balance growth funding needs against autonomy preservation

### Market Dynamics
- **Economic Cycles**: Bull/bear markets affect funding availability and valuations
- **Competitive Landscape**: Opponent lab funding success impacts market conditions
- **Industry Trends**: AI safety concerns affect investor interest in safety-focused labs
- **Regulatory Environment**: Government policy changes impact funding landscape

## Technical Implementation

### Data Models
- **Investor Entities**: Persistent investor objects with relationship metrics
- **Funding Rounds**: Historical record of all funding events with terms and outcomes
- **Board Composition**: Track board seats and voting power
- **Milestone Tracking**: Performance measurement system for investor requirements

### UI Enhancements
- **Funding Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of current funding status and relationships
- **Investor Profiles**: Detailed information about each investor type and relationship

- **Pipeline Visualization**: Show potential future funding rounds and requirements

### Event System Integration
