# Implement Version Validation System\n\nProblem: We need automated checks to prevent version numbering mistakes and ensure quality gates are met before version increments.

Current Issues:
- Manual version updates prone to errors (e.g., v0.7.0 to v0.6.2 regression)
- No validation that version increments follow semantic versioning rules
- No quality gates ensuring documentation/dev blog entries exist for version changes
- No protection against accidental version downgrades

Proposed Solution:
1. Pre-commit version validation hook
2. Quality gate validation (changelog, dev blog entries)
3. Automated version management script
4. GitHub Actions integration

Implementation needed for version integrity and development workflow quality.\n\n<!-- GitHub Issue #305 -->
