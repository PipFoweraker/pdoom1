# Issue: Copilot Context Prompt Improvements for Git/Repository Management

**Created**: September 10, 2025  
**Type**: Documentation Enhancement  
**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: Pending Review  

## Background

After successfully implementing a comprehensive branching strategy and cleaning up the repository (59 -> 7 branches, 88% reduction), several context prompt improvements became apparent that would make future Git/repository management sessions more efficient.

## Problem Statement

Current copilot instructions lack specific context about:
- Repository branching state and established workflows
- Recently completed organizational work (to avoid redundancy)
- Available tools and documentation for branch management
- Quality assurance patterns specific to this repository

## Suggested Additions to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### 1. Repository State Management Section

```markdown
## Repository State Management

### Current Branching Strategy
- **Main workflow**: main -> develop -> feature/* -> hotfix/*
- **Protection rules**: [Enabled/Disabled] branch protection on main/develop
- **Cleanup status**: Last cleanup performed on [date], reduced from X to Y branches
- **Active branches**: List current feature/hotfix branches in progress

### Git Workflow Preferences
- **Merge strategy**: [merge commits/squash/rebase] 
- **Tag format**: v0.0.0 for releases, v0.0.0-hotfix for hotfixes
- **Cleanup frequency**: [weekly/monthly] branch maintenance preferred
- **Branch naming**: feature/description, hotfix/description, experimental/description
```

### 2. Development Workflow Section

```markdown
## Development Process Status

### Current Session Type
- **Focus area**: [feature development/hotfix/cleanup/documentation/testing]
- **Branching needs**: [new feature branch/complete hotfix/organize branches]
- **Testing requirements**: Always run full test suite (38+ seconds), expect ~500 tests

### Repository Tools Available
- **Branch cleanup script**: `tools/cleanup_branches.sh` for maintenance
- **Documentation**: Complete branching strategy in `docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`
- **Protection guide**: GitHub setup in `docs/GITHUB_BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`
```

### 3. Quality Assurance Additions

```markdown
### Branch Management Quality Checks
- **Before major changes**: Run `git fetch --prune` to sync branch state
- **Test validation**: Use `python -c 'from src.core.game_state import GameState; GameState('test')'` for quick checks
- **Branch analysis**: Use cleanup script to review repository health
- **Merge validation**: Ensure hotfixes merge to both main AND develop
```

### 4. Session Context Tracking

```markdown
### Recent Repository Changes
- **Last major cleanup**: [date] - reduced branches from X to Y
- **Last hotfix**: [branch name] completed on [date]
- **Documentation status**: Branching strategy implemented and documented
- **Protection status**: [Enabled/Pending] GitHub branch protection rules
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **Immediately understand** current branching state in new sessions
2. **Avoid redundant work** (like re-implementing already completed strategies)
3. **Follow established patterns** for branch naming and workflows
4. **Maintain consistency** with documented processes
5. **Reference available tools** instead of recreating them

## Implementation Notes

- Review against existing copilot instructions to avoid conflicts
- Consider which sections are static vs. dynamic (need regular updates)
- Determine update frequency for dynamic content
- Test effectiveness in actual development sessions

## Current Repository State (for reference)

- **Branches**: 7 total (main, develop, release/staging, experimental/playground, plus 3 review branches)
- **Tools**: Complete branch management toolkit implemented
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive branching strategy documented
- **Workflow**: Hotfix workflow tested and validated (v0.2.12-hotfix)
- **Cleanup**: 88% branch reduction completed (59 -> 7 branches)

## Action Items

- [ ] Review suggestions against existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- [ ] Identify conflicts or redundancies with current instructions
- [ ] Determine which additions provide most value
- [ ] Create diff/comparison document
- [ ] Test selected improvements in next development session
- [ ] Update instructions with approved changes
