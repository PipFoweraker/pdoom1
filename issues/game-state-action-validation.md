# Game State Action Validation Issues

## Description
Game state has action validation and state management issues affecting core gameplay.

## Affected Tests
- `test_game_state.py::TestGameState::test_action_validation`
- `test_game_state.py::TestGameState::test_apply_action_with_insufficient_resources`

## Error Details
```
AssertionError: False is not true
Action validation failing when it should pass
Expected action to be rejected due to insufficient resources
```

## Root Cause
1. Action validation logic incorrectly rejecting valid actions
2. Resource checking not properly preventing insufficient resource actions
3. State management not properly tracking resource constraints

## Expected Behavior
- Valid actions should pass validation
- Actions requiring more resources than available should be rejected
- Game state should accurately track and enforce resource constraints

## Investigation Areas
1. Action validation logic in game_state.py
2. Resource checking mechanisms
3. Action execution prerequisites
4. State consistency during action processing

## Priority
High - Affects core game mechanics and action system
