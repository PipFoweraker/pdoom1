# (0.5) alliance meetings / voting systems, maybe once every 6 months?\n\nIdea:
Every 6 months or whatever, a secret cabal of safety org leaders (in robes?) gathers to vote on things, this is where some of the alliance and internal favour mechanics will come in. Thematically like maybe the reepublicans gathering Simspsons?

This also allows for simple face animations like the  please and displeased displays by the 8 bit leaders when yuo engage in dialogue with them.

e.g.  

UK AISI is VERY DISPLEASED that you voted to RETAIN PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR IMMIGRANTS

These small in-game events build into the narrative arc of the story and provide points for complex decisions outside the normal resource trade-off balance that the regular game turn mechanic constrains us to. This probably refers to our morality and consequences systems and may need further development? This might slip down the timeline and I would be fine with it. - Pip\n\n<!-- GitHub Issue #222 -->
