This guide will help you get started, understand the interface, and make effective decisions.

## What is P(Doom)?

P(Doom) is a satirical strategy game about managing an AI safety lab. Your goals are to manage resources, handle events, and survive longer than the reckless "frontier" labs racing to dangerous AI.

## Game Loop Overview

- **Select actions** (left panel) by clicking their buttons. Each costs money and has effects (see tooltips).
- **Buy upgrades** (right panel) by clicking available upgrade buttons. Purchased upgrades shrink to icons at the top right.
- **End your turn** by clicking the "END TURN" button (bottom center) or pressing `Space`.
  - **Event Log Reset:** When you end your turn, the activity log is automatically cleared
  - This ensures you only see events from the current turn, keeping information fresh and relevant
- **View resource changes** and random events in the activity log (bottom left).
- **Repeat:** Take actions, buy upgrades, end turn, and react to events.
- **Game ends** if:
  - p(Doom) reaches 100 (catastrophe).
  - All your staff leave.
  - The opponent lab reaches 100 progress.

## UI Layout

- **Top Bar:** Money, Staff, Reputation, p(Doom), Opponent Progress, Turn, Seed.
- **Left Column:** Actions you can take this turn.
- **Right Column:** Upgrades (buttons if available, icons if purchased).
- **Bottom Center:** "END TURN" button.
- **Bottom Left:** **Activity Log** (recent events, outcomes)
  - **Important:** The activity log is automatically cleared at the start of each turn
  - Only shows events from the current turn - previous turn events are removed
  - This ensures you see only fresh, relevant information for decision-making
  - Examples of messages: action confirmations, event outcomes, resource changes
  - **Scrollable Event Log Upgrade:** After turn 5, you may unlock an enhanced event log system:
    * **Visual Enhancement:** The event log gains a blue border and "Scrollable" indicator
    * **Full History:** Access to complete activity history from all previous turns
    * **Navigation:** Use arrow keys (↑↓) or mouse wheel to scroll through past events
    * **Turn Organization:** History is organized by turn headers (e.g., "=== Turn 3 ===")
    * **Backward Compatibility:** Current turn events still appear normally for immediate reference
- **Scoreboard:** Appears when game ends (game over summary, high score).

## Actions

Here are the actions you can take each turn (subject to funds):

- **Grow Community:** +Reputation, possible new staff. Costs money.
- **Fundraise:** Gain money (scaled by reputation), possible small reputation loss.
- **Safety Research:** Reduce p(Doom), +Reputation. Costly.
- **Governance Research:** Reduce p(Doom), +Reputation. Costly.
- **Hire Staff:** Gain staff, costs money.
- **Espionage:** Chance to learn opponent progress (risky).

Action details and costs are displayed on each button.

---

## Upgrades

Upgrades give ongoing benefits and can be purchased if you have enough money:

- **Upgrade Computer System:** Boosts research effectiveness.
- **Buy Comfy Office Chairs:** Staff less likely to leave if unpaid.
- **Secure Cloud Provider:** Reduces severity of doom spikes from breakthroughs.

Purchased upgrades are shown as icons at the top right; hover for tooltips.

---

## Events

Random events may occur after each turn. Pay attention to the log for effects such as:

- Lab breakthroughs (increase p(Doom))
- Funding crises (lose money)
- Staff burnout (lose staff)
- Special purchases (e.g., accounting software: unlocks balance change display)

---

## High Score

At game over, your survived turns are shown and stored per seed.  
Compete for the best streak!

## Advanced Features

### Scrollable Event Log

The **Scrollable Event Log** is an advanced feature that becomes available as your organization grows. This feature enhances your ability to track and review historical activity.

#### How to Unlock

- **Automatic Trigger:** The event log upgrade becomes available after **Turn 5**
- **Event:** "Event Log System Upgrade" - Your organization upgrades its event tracking system
- **No Cost:** This upgrade is provided automatically when conditions are met

#### Features

**Enhanced Visual Design:**
- Blue border around the activity log area
- "Activity Log (Scrollable)" title with scroll instructions
- Visual scroll indicators (▲▼) when more content is available

**Complete History Access:**
- View all events from previous turns, not just current turn
- Turn headers organize events by turn (e.g., "=== Turn 3 ===")
- Events include: actions taken, random events, resource changes, upgrade purchases

**Navigation Controls:**
- **Arrow Keys:** Use ↑ and ↓ to scroll up and down through history
- **Mouse Wheel:** Scroll up and down through the event log
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigate through multiple turns of activity seamlessly

**Smart Display:**
- Current turn events remain visible for immediate reference
- History is preserved indefinitely while the feature is active
- Turn headers help you quickly locate specific periods of activity

#### Usage Tips

1. **Strategic Review:** Use the history to review what strategies worked in previous turns
2. **Event Tracking:** Keep track of random events and their timing
3. **Resource Management:** Review past resource changes to identify spending patterns
4. **Decision Making:** Reference past actions when planning future strategies

#### Technical Details

- History storage begins when the feature is unlocked (not retroactive to earlier turns)
- Current turn events function exactly as before - the feature is additive
- Scroll position resets when starting a new game
- The feature remains active for the duration of the game once unlocked

## Troubleshooting

- If the game window is too small or crowded, resize it.
- If you encounter bugs, restart the game or check the README for troubleshooting tips.

## Testing

If you're interested in contributing to P(Doom) or want to verify the game works correctly on your system, you can run the automated tests.

### Running Tests

1. **Install testing dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```
   pip install pytest
   ```
   Or install all dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run all tests:**
   ```
   pytest
   ```

3. **Run tests with verbose output:**
   ```
   pytest -v
   ```

### Sample Test Output

**When tests pass:**
```
============================= test session starts ==============================

**When tests fail:**
```

```

### Troubleshooting

**"No module named pytest"**
- Install pytest: `pip install pytest` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**"Import errors"**
- Make sure you're running tests from the project root directory
- Try: `python -m pytest` instead of just `pytest`

**"Permission denied" or file access errors**
- Check that you have read/write permissions in the project directory
- On some systems, use `python3` instead of `python`

### Test Coverage

This project maintains automated tests to ensure game stability and functionality. Current test coverage includes:

- **GameState (`tests/test_game_state.py`)**: 
  - GameState initialization and default values
  - Core resource setup (money, staff, reputation, doom)
  - Game state collections and properties

- **Upgrades (`tests/test_upgrades.py`)**:
  - Upgrade purchasing with sufficient money
  - Upgrade purchase failure with insufficient money  
  - Prevention of duplicate purchases
  - Upgrade effect activation and management
  - Success and failure message generation
  - Upgrade initialization and structure validation

**Contributors:** Please keep this Test Coverage section current when adding new test files or expanding test coverage. This helps other contributors understand what is already tested and what areas might need additional testing.

### For Contributors

See the README.md for detailed information about adding new tests, test structure, and contributor guidelines. When contributing:

1. **Always add or update tests** for your changes
2. **Run the full test suite** before submitting: `pytest`
3. **Update the Test Coverage section** in both README.md and PLAYERGUIDE.md when adding new tests
4. **Ensure all tests pass** - don't break existing functionality
