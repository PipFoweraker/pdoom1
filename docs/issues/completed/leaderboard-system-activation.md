# Enable and Configure Leaderboard System for Alpha

## Summary
**PRIORITY: HIGH** - Activate the existing comprehensive leaderboard system for competitive alpha testing and weekly leagues.

## Status: OK COMPLETED (v0.4.1)

## Strategic Context
- **Goal**: Create competitive engagement and data collection for alpha
- **Components**: Local rankings, weekly leagues, pseudonymous submission
- **Timeline**: Alpha launch critical feature

## Current State - SYSTEM EXISTS!
**Found comprehensive leaderboard infrastructure:**
- OK `LocalLeaderboard` class with full ranking system
- OK `LeaderboardManager` with privacy-respecting submission
- OK `ScoreEntry` system with metadata tracking
- OK High score UI screen (placeholder state)
- OK Privacy manager with pseudonym generation

## Required Activation Tasks

### Phase 1: Basic Leaderboard (Alpha Launch)
1. **Enable local leaderboard**: Configure `LocalLeaderboard` for game completion
2. **Update high score UI**: Replace placeholder with actual leaderboard display
3. **Score calculation**: Define scoring methodology (turns survived + bonuses)
4. **Weekly reset**: Implement weekly league mechanics

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Alpha+)  
5. **Game mode filtering**: Separate leaderboards for difficulty levels
6. **Statistics display**: Show player rank, percentiles, progress
7. **Privacy controls**: User-friendly opt-in/opt-out interface
8. **Data validation**: Checksum verification for score integrity

## Implementation Files
- **Core**: `src/scores/local_store.py` (ready)
- **Manager**: `src/services/leaderboard.py` (ready) 
- **UI**: `ui.py` draw_high_score_screen() (needs activation)
- **Integration**: `main.py` score submission hooks (needs wiring)

## Configuration Requirements
```python
# Enable leaderboard by default for alpha
ALPHA_LEADERBOARD_ENABLED = True
WEEKLY_LEAGUE_RESET = True
DEFAULT_SUBMISSION_OPT_IN = True  # Alpha only
```

## Success Criteria OK COMPLETED
- [x] Players see leaderboard after game completion
- [x] Scores persist between game sessions  
- [x] Seed-specific leaderboards (ENHANCED beyond requirement)
- [x] Privacy controls function correctly (Anonymous by default)
- [x] Score submission works without errors

## Testing Requirements OK COMPLETED
- [x] Multiple game completions create leaderboard entries
- [x] Rank calculation works correctly (highest score first)
- [x] UI displays top scores properly (top 15 with rank coloring)
- [x] Enhanced metadata tracking (money, staff, doom, economic model)
- [x] **BONUS**: Configuration hash segregation for versioning
- [x] **BONUS**: Graceful migration and versioning support
- [ ] Pseudonym generation and privacy compliance

## Priority: HIGH
**Effort**: 2-4 hours (mostly UI integration)
**Impact**: HIGH - Players need progress tracking and competitive elements for engagement

## OK IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED (v0.4.1)

**Delivered**: Enhanced leaderboard system with seed-specific tracking

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **EnhancedLeaderboardManager**: Comprehensive leaderboard system with seed segregation
2. **GameSession Tracking**: Detailed metadata collection for each game session
3. **Seed-Specific Leaderboards**: Players can compete on specific seeds with separate rankings
4. **Configuration Hash Segregation**: Leaderboards remain valid across game version changes
5. **Enhanced UI Integration**: High score screen shows actual leaderboard data with rankings
6. **Persistent JSON Storage**: All data saved to `leaderboards/` directory with atomic writes
7. **Comprehensive Metadata**: Tracks money, staff, doom, economic model, duration, and more

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/scores/enhanced_leaderboard.py` - Core leaderboard management system
- `src/core/game_state.py` - Integrated session tracking and end-game handling
- `ui.py` - Enhanced high score screen with actual leaderboard display
- `leaderboards/` directory - Persistent JSON storage for all leaderboard data

### Testing Results:
- OK Multiple games per seed create ranked entries
- OK Seed-specific segregation works correctly  
- OK UI displays top 15 entries with proper ranking colors
- OK Natural game over conditions trigger leaderboard saves
- OK Score calculation uses final turn (higher = better survival)
- OK Metadata includes economic model, final resources, and game statistics

**User Impact**: Players can now track progress across multiple games with 'if I play 10 games I can see my efforts start to stack up' - mission accomplished!
**Risk**: Low (existing robust system)
