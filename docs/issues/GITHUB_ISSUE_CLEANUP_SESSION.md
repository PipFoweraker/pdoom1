# GitHub Issue Sync Cleanup Session

## URGENT: Issue Sync Tool Created Potential Duplicates

### Situation Summary
During the Privacy-Respecting Game Run Logger implementation push, the GitHub issue sync tool experienced API authentication/connectivity issues and potentially created 47 duplicate issues on the GitHub repository.

**Evidence of Problems**:
- Unicode decode errors: `UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x90`
- JSON parsing failures: `Error: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType`
- Tool reported 'GitHub issues: 0' when repository likely had existing issues
- Tool then created 47 issues that may be duplicates

### Immediate Assessment Required

**Step 1: Check GitHub Repository State**
```bash
# Visit GitHub issues page to assess damage
# https://github.com/PipFoweraker/pdoom1/issues
```

**Look For**:
- Duplicate issues with similar titles
- Recent bulk creation of 47+ issues
- Whether existing issues were preserved or overwritten

**Step 2: Validate Sync Tool Functionality**
```bash
cd 'c:\Users\gday\Documents\A Local Code\pdoom1'

# Test authentication
python tools/github-issue-sync.py --dry-run

# Check if API errors persist
# Look for Unicode decode errors or JSON parsing failures
```

### Cleanup Strategy Options

#### Option A: If Duplicates Exist (Most Likely)
**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Document the scope**: Count how many duplicates were created
2. **Identify patterns**: Look for duplicate titles/content
3. **Preserve legitimate issues**: Ensure no real issues are lost
4. **Bulk cleanup**: Use GitHub API or manual cleanup for duplicates

**Tools Available**:
- GitHub web interface for manual cleanup
- GitHub CLI for bulk operations
- Custom cleanup script if needed

#### Option B: If Sync Tool is Broken (API Issues)
**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. **Check GitHub token**: Verify authentication credentials
2. **Test API connectivity**: Simple GitHub API test calls
3. **Encoding issues**: Fix Unicode handling in sync tool
4. **Network diagnostics**: Ensure GitHub API is accessible

### Recovery Implementation

#### Quick Manual Cleanup (if < 20 duplicates)
```bash
# Use GitHub web interface
# Delete duplicates one by one
# Preserve any issues that were created legitimately
```

#### Automated Cleanup (if 20+ duplicates)
```bash
# Create cleanup script to:
# 1. List all GitHub issues
# 2. Compare with local issues/ directory
# 3. Identify true duplicates by title/content
# 4. Batch delete duplicates via GitHub API
```

#### Sync Tool Repair (if tool is fundamentally broken)
```bash
# Fix authentication issues
# Resolve Unicode encoding problems
# Add better error handling
# Test with dry-run before real operations
```

### Prevention Measures

**Before Any Future Sync Operations**:
1. **Always use --dry-run first** to verify tool functionality
2. **Check GitHub API connectivity** independently
3. **Verify authentication** before bulk operations
4. **Backup issue state** if possible before major syncs

### Success Criteria

- [ ] GitHub repository has clean issue list (no obvious duplicates)
- [ ] All legitimate issues are preserved
- [ ] Issue #317 (Privacy Controls UI Integration) is properly tracked
- [ ] Sync tool functions correctly for future use
- [ ] Authentication and API connectivity issues resolved

### Context Preservation

**Important**: The core Privacy-Respecting Game Run Logger implementation is SAFE and successfully pushed to `feature/player-run-logging` branch. This cleanup is purely administrative - the technical work is complete and ready for the UI integration phase.

**Files to Reference**:
- Current branch: `feature/player-run-logging` 
- Implementation: Complete backend system (669 lines, 24 tests)
- Next phase: Issue #317 Privacy Controls UI Integration
- Documentation: `docs/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` has UI integration roadmap

### Emergency Fallback

If cleanup becomes too complex:
1. **Close/hide all duplicate issues** with explanation
2. **Create fresh Issue #317** for Privacy Controls UI work
3. **Disable automatic sync** until tool is repaired
4. **Continue with manual issue management** temporarily

The priority is getting back to productive development work, not perfect issue tracking administration.

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Assess the situation
# 1. Check GitHub issues page in browser
# 2. Run diagnostic on sync tool
cd 'c:\Users\gday\Documents\A Local Code\pdoom1'
python tools/github-issue-sync.py --dry-run

# 3. Plan cleanup strategy based on findings
```

**Time Estimate**: 30-60 minutes depending on scope of duplicates and tool repair needs.
