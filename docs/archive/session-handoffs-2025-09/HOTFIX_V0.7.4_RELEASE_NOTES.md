- **Files**: Action availability logic improvements

### 3. FIXED: End Game State Reset Bug
**Issue**: Game state persisting after game over, affecting next session  
**Fix**: Game State Manager service  
- **Service**: Comprehensive state reset mechanisms
- **Impact**: Clean slate for new games, no state bleed-through
- **Files**: `src/core/game_state.py` reset improvements

### 4. FIXED: Action Point Display Bug
**Issue**: Action point counter showing incorrect values or not updating  
**Fix**: Display state management with Action Availability Manager  
- **Service**: Centralized display state handling
- **Impact**: Accurate, real-time action point display
- **Files**: UI display logic improvements

### 5. FIXED: Research Quality Selection Bug - **MAJOR FEATURE**
**Issue**: Research quality submenu only showing 1 option instead of all 3  
**Solution**: **Complete dashboard system implementation**  
- **Service**: `src/services/dashboard_manager.py` (310 lines)
- **Integration**: Full main.py game loop integration
- **Features**:
  - Persistent research quality panel (gentle orange theme)
  - Three quality options: Fast, Balanced, Careful
  - No action points required (settings-style interface)
  - Civilization-style government configuration approach
  - Modular architecture for future dashboard elements
- **Impact**: Transforms modal dialog into persistent UI element

## NEW ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS

### Dashboard Manager Service
```
src/services/dashboard_manager.py (310 lines)
|-- DashboardElementType enum
|-- DashboardElementConfig dataclass  
|-- DashboardManager class
|-- Research quality selector with hover effects
|-- Click handling and theme system
+-- Extensible for government style, economic policy, etc.
```

### General Submenu Manager Service  
```
src/services/general_submenu_manager.py (created but not used)
|-- Comprehensive submenu handling
|-- Theme support (research=greenish, hiring=blue, funding=gold)
|-- SubmenuButtonState management
+-- Foundation for future UI consistency
```

## USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS

### Research Quality Dashboard
- **Location**: Below End Turn button, persistent across turns
- **Theme**: Gentle orange color scheme for visual distinction
- **Interaction**: Click to change, no action points consumed
- **Options**: 
  - **Fast**: Quick results, higher risk (orange highlight)
  - **Balanced**: Default approach (gray highlight)
  - **Careful**: Slower but safer (green highlight)

### Visual Feedback
- Hover effects on all dashboard elements
- Current selection highlighting
- Smooth integration with existing UI themes
- No disruption to existing gameplay flow

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Integration Points
1. **UI Rendering**: `ui.py` - Dashboard elements added to main draw loop
2. **Mouse Handling**: `main.py` - Click and hover event handling
3. **State Management**: `game_state.py` - Research quality unlock triggers
4. **Service Pattern**: Consistent singleton pattern for all managers

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Type Annotations**: Comprehensive typing throughout new services
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management in all new systems
- **Documentation**: Extensive inline documentation and docstrings

### Performance Considerations
- **Singleton Services**: Minimal memory overhead
- **Lazy Loading**: Services created only when needed
- **Efficient Rendering**: Dashboard elements cached and optimized
