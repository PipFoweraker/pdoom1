**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Duration**: ~2.5 hours
**Token Usage**: 90k / 200k (45%)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 5 (one bug to fix)

---

---

## What We Built

### 1. Godot Phase 4 MVP

**Core Files**:
- `godot/scripts/game_manager.gd` (252 lines) - Bridge communication
- `godot/scripts/ui/main_ui.gd` (136 lines) - UI controller
- `godot/scenes/main.tscn` - Main game scene
- `godot/README.md` - Comprehensive guide
- `godot/SETUP.md` - Installation instructions
- `godot/UI_DESIGN_VISION.md` - Design philosophy

**Infrastructure**:
- Downloaded Godot 4.5 to `tools/godot/` (156MB, gitignored)
- Python bridge tested and working via CLI
- GDScript validates without errors

**Testing**:
- ‚úÖ UI loads perfectly
- ‚úÖ Scene structure works
- ‚úÖ Signals connected
- ‚ùå Bridge communication needs fix (PowerShell escaping)

### 2. Documentation Reorganization

**Root Cleanup** (19 ‚Üí 2 files):
```
Before: 19 .md files cluttering root
After:  README.md + CHANGELOG.md only
```

**New Structure**:
- `docs/current/` - Active work tracking
  - `GODOT_MIGRATION_TRACKER.md` - **Check here first!**
- `docs/archive/session-handoffs/2025-10/` - October sessions (10 files)
- `docs/archive/by-topic/copilot-instructions/` - Historical configs
- `docs/archive/by-topic/hotfixes-2025-09/` - September cleanup

**Updated Docs**:
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Reflects new structure
- `docs/GODOT_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Ongoing strategy

### 3. Design Assets Discovery

**Found 4 Cat Images** üê±:
1. "Doom's Cat Throne" (GPT-generated artwork)
2. "Ominous Office Inferno" (GPT-generated backdrop)
3. "pdoom1 office cat default"
4. "small doom caat" (adorable typo!)

**Design Direction**:
- Extract techno retro style from pygame loading screen
- Import fonts, colors, layout patterns
- Implement cat easter eggs (original concept stalled until now)
- Documented in `godot/DESIGN_ASSETS_TODO.md`

## GitHub Activity

**Issues Closed**:
- #390 - Pygame UI bug (wontfix - deprecated)
- #257 - Action list display (wontfix - deprecated)

**Issues Created**:
- #426 - Godot Phase 5: Core Features (dynamic actions, events)

**Commits Pushed** (3):
1. `c32dfd9f` - feat(godot): Implement Phase 4 MVP
2. `a8436a9f` - docs: October 2025 documentation reorganization
3. `51b6f4f9` - docs: Phase 4 test results and design assets plan

---

## Test Results

### Screenshot 1: Success ‚úÖ
- UI loaded perfectly
- All elements visible
- GameManager initialized
- Console output clean
- Message log working

### Screenshot 2: Bridge Error ‚ùå
- Clicked "Init Game"
- **ERROR: No valid response from bridge**
- Resources unchanged (Money stayed $0, should be $100k)

**Root Cause**: PowerShell command escaping
- JSON quotes conflicting with PowerShell quotes
- Path has spaces ("Organising Life")
- Need better string escaping or alternative approach

**Fix Options**:
1. Debug PowerShell escaping (quick)
2. Use file-based IPC (reliable fallback)
3. Persistent Python process (future optimization)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Extremely Well

1. **Documentation First**
   - Reading session handoff gave perfect context
   - UI_DESIGN_VISION documented user intent upfront
   - Clear separation: active vs archived docs

2. **Incremental Approach**
   - Test CLI bridge before Godot integration
   - Validate GDScript in headless mode
   - Quick feedback loop caught issue immediately

3. **User Collaboration**
   - Pausing to discuss UI philosophy prevented wasted work
   - Screenshots shared for immediate debugging
   - Design preferences captured for future work

4. **Archive Strategy**
   - Monthly session handoffs ‚Üí easy to find context
   - By-topic archives ‚Üí thematic organization
   - `current/` directory ‚Üí clear "what's happening now"

### What Could Be Better

1. **Testing Bridge in Godot Earlier**
   - Could have tested bridge call during implementation
   - Would have caught PowerShell issue before "done"
   - **Fix**: Add bridge test to development checklist

2. **Tool Automation**
   - Manual file moves are tedious
   - Should build `tools/archive-docs.sh` next session
   - **Fix**: Prioritize automation scripts

3. **Progress Visibility**
   - Phase tracker created at end of session
   - Would be nice to update throughout
   - **Fix**: Template for "update tracker after each commit"

---

## Process Improvements

### For Next Session

**1. Start with Context Review** (5 min)
- Read `docs/current/GODOT_MIGRATION_TRACKER.md`
- Check recent GitHub issues
- Review last session's handoff

**2. Use Todo List Throughout**
- Create todos at session start
- Update after each major milestone
- Mark complete immediately (not batched)

**3. Test Early, Test Often**
- Don't wait until "done" to test
- Validate each component independently
- Test integration points as they're built

**4. Document Decisions in Real-Time**
- Capture "why" when making choices
- Update tracker after each phase step
- Add troubleshooting notes when bugs found

**5. End Session Checklist**
- [ ] Update phase tracker
- [ ] Archive session handoff
- [ ] Commit and push all changes
- [ ] Create/update GitHub issues
- [ ] Note blockers clearly

### Automation Priorities

**High Priority** (Build Next):
1. `tools/archive-session.sh` - Move session handoffs automatically
2. `tools/doc-health.py` - Check for root-level docs, broken links
3. `tools/update-tracker.sh` - Update phase tracker from git commits

**Medium Priority** (After Phase 6):
4. `tools/gen-doc-index.py` - Auto-generate DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
5. GitHub Action for doc linting
6. Pre-commit hook to warn about root-level .md files

**Low Priority** (Nice to Have):
7. Phase progress calculator (scan files for completion)
8. Screenshot annotator (add notes to test screenshots)
9. Session timer/stats tracker

---

## Documentation Best Practices (Discovered)

### Entry Points Matter
- **Problem**: 178 docs, hard to find "what's current"
- **Solution**: `docs/current/` directory + tracker
- **Result**: Clear starting point for any session

### Archive by Date AND Topic
- **Problem**: Session handoffs mixed with completion summaries
- **Solution**: `archive/session-handoffs/YYYY-MM/` + `archive/by-topic/`
- **Result**: Find by "when" or "what"

### Update Index Immediately
- **Problem**: Index gets stale, becomes useless
- **Solution**: Update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md in same commit as moves
- **Result**: Index always reflects actual structure

### Verbose is OK for Archives
- **Problem**: Worried about docs being too detailed
- **Solution**: Archive = verbose context, current = concise action
- **Result**: Future-you has full context, present-you has clarity

## Technical Insights

### Godot Strengths
- Scene system is MUCH cleaner than pygame's manual rendering
- Signals make UI reactivity trivial
- Built-in UI controls save tons of code
- Headless validation catches errors early

### Godot Gotchas
- PowerShell on Windows is finicky
- OS.execute behaves differently than bash
- Path spaces need careful handling
- F5 runs game, but editor opens first (minor confusion)

### Python Bridge
- stdin/stdout works great in CLI
- PowerShell pipes add complexity
- File-based IPC might be more reliable on Windows
- Persistent process would be faster long-term

### JJ Workflow
- `jj new` after push is excellent practice
- Empty working copy prevents accidental commits
- Descriptive commits help future sessions
- Push frequently (2-3 times per session)

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Bridge Fix Approach**: Try PowerShell debug or switch to file IPC?
2. **Action List Layout**: Scrollable list or grid of buttons?
3. **Event Popups**: Modal dialog or sidebar panel?
4. **Cat Easter Egg**: Wait for Phase 6 or implement alongside Phase 5?
