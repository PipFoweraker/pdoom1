# Development Log - P(Doom) 3-Column UI Layout

## 2025-09-04: 3-Column Layout Implementation

### Completed Features:
- ✅ Implemented 3-column layout system with retro neon styling
- ✅ Left column: Core repeating actions (Community, Fundraise, Research, etc.)
- ✅ Middle column: Research team display (simplified for playtesting)
- ✅ Right column: Strategic actions (Lobby, Board, etc.)
- ✅ Reduced initial UI clutter - only essential actions shown in early game
- ✅ Improved action text management with shortcuts and truncation
- ✅ Context window integration with action details
- ✅ Configuration system to enable/disable 3-column layout

### UI Improvements Made:
- Shortened button text with smart abbreviations
- Larger buttons for readability (50px height for core actions)
- Color-coded columns with retro green theme
- Better column headers: "CORE ACTIONS", "RESEARCH TEAM", "STRATEGY"
- Early game filtering - only shows 4 essential actions initially

### Temporarily Disabled (for cleaner playtest):
- ❌ Employee blob animations (will re-enable in future build)
  - Reason: Needed cleaner middle column for 4-hour playtest deadline
  - Location: ui_new/layouts/three_column.py, _draw_employee_section()
  - Future: Re-implement with improved positioning and animations

### Configuration Changes:
- Added `enable_three_column_layout: true` to default.json
- Reduced context window height to 10% for better space usage
- Added retro styling configuration options

### Technical Implementation:
- New module: ui_new/layouts/three_column.py
- Updated ui_new/screens/game.py to use 3-column layout
- Enhanced ui_new/facade.py with layout selection
- Added context helpers in ui_new/components/context_helpers.py
- Extended color palette in ui_new/components/colours.py

### Performance Notes:
- Layout calculation done once per frame
- Action filtering reduces UI complexity significantly
- Context window provides detailed action info without button clutter

### Next Steps (Post-Playtest):
1. Gather playtest feedback on 3-column layout
2. Re-enable employee animations with better positioning
3. Add unique keybindings for each action (partially implemented)
4. Fine-tune action categorization based on player behavior
5. Add delegation interface to middle column when unlocked

### Playtest Focus Areas:
- UI clarity and reduced clutter ✅
- Action discoverability ✅  
- Context window usefulness ✅
- Column organization logic ✅
- Performance and responsiveness ✅

**Ready for 4-hour playtest session!**
