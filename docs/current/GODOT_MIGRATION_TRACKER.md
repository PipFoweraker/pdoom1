## Phase 4: MVP UI ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Prove Python bridge works with minimal functional UI
**Duration**: 2025-10-17 (1 session)
**Status**: ‚úÖ All objectives met

### Objectives
- [x] Game manager with Python bridge communication
- [x] Main scene with basic UI layout
- [x] Resource displays (money, compute, safety, turn)
- [x] Test buttons (Init Game, Hire Researcher, End Turn)
- [x] Message log with colored output
- [x] Signal-based UI updates

### Deliverables
- `godot/scripts/game_manager.gd` (252 lines)
- `godot/scripts/ui/main_ui.gd` (136 lines)
- `godot/scenes/main.tscn` (TSCN format)
- `godot/README.md` (comprehensive)
- `godot/SETUP.md` (installation guide)
- `godot/UI_DESIGN_VISION.md` (design philosophy)

### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Python bridge CLI test passed
- ‚úÖ GDScript validation passed
- ‚úÖ Scene loads without errors
- ‚è≥ Manual UI test pending (user step)

### Technical Debt
- PowerShell piping creates new process per command (inefficient)
- Synchronous bridge calls block Godot (needs async)
- Hardcoded test button (needs dynamic action list)

## Phase 5: Core Features üü° NEXT

**Goal**: Dynamic action lists, event system, full turn flow
**Est. Duration**: 2-3 sessions
**Est. Completion**: Late October 2025

### Objectives
- [ ] Load available actions from bridge dynamically
- [ ] Create action buttons with categories
- [ ] Implement event popup system
- [ ] Visual turn phase indicator
- [ ] Test 10+ turn gameplay loop
- [ ] Handle game over / victory conditions

### Priority Tasks
1. **Dynamic Action List** (High Priority)
   - Call `get_actions` from bridge
   - Create buttons programmatically
   - Group by category
   - Show cost, AP cost, description

2. **Event Popup System** (High Priority)
   - Detect events at turn start
   - Show modal popup with choices
   - Send choice back to bridge
   - Update UI after resolution

3. **Turn Phase UI** (Medium Priority)
   - Visual indicator for current phase
   - Disable "End Turn" during TURN_START
   - Show pending events clearly
   - Feedback for action selection

4. **Extended Testing** (Medium Priority)
   - Play 10-20 turns
   - Test all action types
   - Verify event system works
   - Check game over states

### Success Criteria
- All actions available in UI
- Events appear and can be resolved
- Turn flow works correctly for 20+ turns
- No crashes or state corruption
- Message log provides clear feedback

## Phase 6: Feature Parity ‚ö™ PLANNED

**Goal**: Match all pygame features in Godot
**Est. Duration**: 4-6 sessions
**Est. Completion**: November 2025

### Feature Checklist
- [ ] All 30+ actions implemented
- [ ] All events from event pool
- [ ] Employee management UI
- [ ] Milestone notifications
- [ ] Onboarding / tutorial system
- [ ] Settings menu
- [ ] Save / load games
- [ ] High scores / leaderboards
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Sound integration

### UI Enhancements
- [ ] Multiple screens (main, research, employees)
- [ ] Screen switching system
- [ ] Animated transitions
- [ ] Visual feedback for state changes
- [ ] Better styling / theme

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Deploy ‚ö™ PLANNED

**Goal**: Production-ready release
**Est. Duration**: 2-3 sessions
**Est. Completion**: December 2025

### Polish Tasks
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Bug fixes from testing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Tutorial / onboarding polished
- [ ] Visual theme finalized
- [ ] Sound effects integrated

### Deployment
- [ ] Build for Windows
- [ ] Build for Linux (optional)
- [ ] Build for Mac (optional)
- [ ] Distribution setup (itch.io?)
- [ ] Release notes
- [ ] Announce migration complete

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Active Issues
- **3D Scene Editor Issue**: Godot opens to 3D editor instead of running game
  - **Status**: Minor, doesn't block development
  - **Workaround**: Press F5 to run game
  - **Fix**: TBD in Phase 5

### Technical Debt
1. **Synchronous Bridge** - Blocks Godot during Python calls
   - **Impact**: UI freezes during commands
   - **Priority**: Medium (works for MVP)
   - **Fix**: Phase 5 or 6 - implement async communication

2. **Process Per Command** - PowerShell spawns new process each time
   - **Impact**: Inefficient, ~100-200ms overhead per command
   - **Priority**: Low (fast enough for turn-based game)
   - **Fix**: Phase 6 - persistent Python process

3. **Hardcoded Test Button** - "Hire Researcher" is static
   - **Impact**: Can't test other actions in UI
   - **Priority**: High (blocks Phase 5)
   - **Fix**: Phase 5 - dynamic action list

### Pygame Status
- **Status**: Deprecated, not maintained
- **Issues**: Closed as "wontfix" with migration note
- **Code**: Remains in repo as reference, marked DEPRECATED
