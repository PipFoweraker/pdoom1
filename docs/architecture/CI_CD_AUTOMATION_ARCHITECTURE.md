# CI/CD Automation Architecture: Data Lake-Inspired Pipeline

## Current State Analysis (October 9, 2025)

### Existing Infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions**: 12 workflow files with quality checks, issue sync, deployment
- **Standards Enforcement**: Comprehensive `enforce_standards.py` script
- **Web Export System**: Automated leaderboard publishing
- **Issue Tracking**: Text-based local issues with GitHub sync capability
- **Version Management**: Centralized version service

### The Problem: State Synchronization Gap
Our text-based issue tracking (`issues/*.md`) and GitHub Issues are not bidirectionally synchronized. We need a **single source of truth** with automated propagation.

## Target Architecture: Data Lake CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Issue Management Pipeline (Highest Priority)

#### A. Bidirectional Sync System
```bash
# Current: One-way sync (local  ->  GitHub)
issues/*.md  ->  GitHub Issues

# Target: Two-way sync with conflict resolution
issues/*.md  <->  GitHub Issues (with audit trail)
```

#### B. Issue State Machine
```
Local Issue Created  ->  Auto-create GitHub Issue  ->  Link established
GitHub Issue Updated  ->  Auto-update local .md  ->  Maintain references
Branch created from issue  ->  Auto-update status  ->  Track progress
PR merged  ->  Auto-close issue  ->  Archive local file
```

### 2. Branch Management Automation

#### A. Automated Branch Lifecycle
```yaml
# Trigger: New issue created
1. Create feature branch: feature/issue-{number}-{slug}
2. Generate PR template with issue context
3. Set up branch protection rules
4. Configure auto-merge conditions

# Trigger: Branch stale detection
1. Identify stale branches (>30 days, no commits)
2. Auto-create 'branch cleanup' issue
3. Ping stakeholders for decision
4. Auto-archive if no response in 7 days
```

#### B. Develop Branch 'Nuke from Orbit' System
```bash
# Automated develop branch reset
git checkout main
git branch -D develop
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop --force-with-lease
```

### 3. Quality Gates (Data Lake Style)

#### A. Multi-Stage Pipeline
```yaml
Stage 1: Basic Validation (< 30 seconds)
- ASCII compliance check
- Import cleanup validation
- Version consistency
- File structure validation

Stage 2: Code Quality (< 2 minutes)
- Full test suite execution
- Type annotation validation
- Documentation coverage
- Security scanning

Stage 3: Integration Testing (< 5 minutes)
- Cross-module integration tests
- Performance regression detection
- Memory usage validation
- Game state consistency checks

Stage 4: Deployment Readiness (< 1 minute)
- Build artifact generation
- Release notes generation
- Changelog validation
- Distribution packaging
```

#### B. Automated Quality Metrics
```python
# Continuous quality tracking
metrics = {
    'test_coverage': '90%+',
    'type_annotation_coverage': '85%+', 
    'documentation_coverage': '80%+',
    'performance_baseline': 'startup < 2s',
    'memory_usage': '< 200MB steady state'
}
```

### 4. Deployment Pipeline

#### A. Environment Progression
```
Feature Branch  ->  Integration  ->  Staging  ->  Production
      v                v             v            v 
Unit Tests    Integration   UAT Tests   Rollback
             Tests                      Ready
```

#### B. Automated Release Management
```yaml
# Version bump triggers
Patch: Bug fixes, hotfixes  ->  Auto-deploy to staging
Minor: New features  ->  Manual approval  ->  Deploy to production  
Major: Breaking changes  ->  Full regression suite  ->  Manual release
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Issue Sync Architecture
```python
class BidirectionalIssueSync:
    def __init__(self):
        self.github_client = GitHubClient()
        self.local_issues = LocalIssueManager()
        self.conflict_resolver = ConflictResolver()
        
    def sync_bidirectional(self):
        # 1. Fetch GitHub issues
        github_issues = self.github_client.get_all_issues()
        
        # 2. Load local issues
        local_issues = self.local_issues.load_all()
        
        # 3. Detect conflicts and resolve
        conflicts = self.detect_conflicts(github_issues, local_issues)
        resolved = self.conflict_resolver.resolve(conflicts)
        
        # 4. Apply changes bidirectionally
        self.apply_github_updates(resolved.github_updates)
        self.apply_local_updates(resolved.local_updates)
        
        # 5. Update audit trail
        self.audit_trail.record_sync(resolved)
```

### 2. Quality Metrics Collection
```python
class QualityMetricsCollector:
    def collect_all_metrics(self):
        return {
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
            'test_coverage': self.get_test_coverage(),
            'type_annotations': self.count_type_annotations(),
            'performance': self.run_performance_benchmarks(),
            'memory_usage': self.measure_memory_usage(),
            'code_quality': self.run_static_analysis()
        }
```

### 3. Automated Branch Management
```bash
# !/bin/bash
# scripts/manage_branches.sh

# Detect stale branches
STALE_BRANCHES=$(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate)' refs/heads | 
                 awk '$2 <= ''$(date -d '30 days ago' '+%Y-%m-%d')''' | 
                 cut -d' ' -f1)

# Create cleanup issues for stale branches
for branch in $STALE_BRANCHES; do
    ./scripts/create_cleanup_issue.py --branch '$branch'
done

# Auto-merge ready PRs
gh pr list --state open --json number,mergeable,checks | 
jq '.[] | select(.mergeable == true and .checks[].conclusion == 'success')' |
while read pr; do
    gh pr merge '$(echo $pr | jq -r '.number')' --auto --squash
done
```
