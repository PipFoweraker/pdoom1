- **Future Releases Milestone**: 31 issues (appropriately deferred)
- **Closed as Completed**: 2 issues (#253, #244)
- **Closed as Duplicates**: 1 issue (#307)

### Phase Organization (v1.0.0 Issues)
- **Phase 1 Critical** (`phase-1-critical`): ~12 issues
  - Test suite segmentation fault
  - Sound system integration failures
  - Menu system integration bugs
  - Configuration consistency issues
  
- **Phase 2 Quick Wins** (`phase-2-quick-wins`): ~5 issues
  - Leaderboard system activation
  - Player run logging system
  - Branch consolidation cleanup
  
- **Phase 3 Architecture** (`phase-3-architecture`): ~8 issues
  - Complete type annotations
  - UI monolith breakdown
  - Deterministic RNG migration

## [EMOJI][EMOJI] Infrastructure Created

### GitHub Organization
1. **Milestones**:
   - `v1.0.0 Release` (due Oct 15, 2025) - 25 focused issues
   - `Future Releases` (due Dec 31, 2025) - 31 deferred features
   
2. **Labels**:
   - `strategic` - High-level architectural decisions
   - `phase-1-critical` - Critical stability fixes
   - `phase-2-quick-wins` - Quick implementation wins  
   - `phase-3-architecture` - Architecture prep work

3. **Branch Alignment**:
   - Issues directly map to strategic branches
   - Clear development path from critical -> quick wins -> architecture
   - Realistic scope for stable 1.0.0 release

### Strategic Decisions

#### Aggressive Scope Reduction [EMOJI]
**Deferred to Post-1.0.0** (31 issues):
- Multi-turn action delegation
- Advanced developer tools
- Website integration and deployment
- Complex UI enhancements
- Art assets and visual improvements
- Alliance/diplomacy systems
- Geopolitics and regulations
- Advanced game mechanics

#### v1.0.0 Focus [EMOJI]
**Critical Path** (25 issues):
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Essential system integration
- Type safety and code quality
- Basic UI functionality
- Core game mechanic validation

## [ROCKET] Next Actions

### Immediate Priority (New Session)
1. **Switch to `fix/test-suite-segfault` branch**
2. **Isolate segmentation fault source** 
3. **Fix critical testing blocker**
4. **Validate test suite stability**

### Development Sequence
```
Phase 1: fix/test-suite-segfault -> fix/sound-system-integration -> fix/menu-system-integration -> fix/configuration-consistency

Phase 2: feature/leaderboard-activation -> feature/player-run-logging -> chore/branch-consolidation

Phase 3: refactor/complete-type-annotations -> refactor/ui-architecture-prep -> planning/post-1.0.0-roadmap
```

## [PARTY] Impact

- **Transformed chaos** -> **organized development workflow**
- **Eliminated scope creep** -> **realistic v1.0.0 target**
- **Clear priorities** -> **systematic execution path**
- **GitHub integration** -> **trackable progress**

Ready for focused implementation in fresh context window! [FIRE]
