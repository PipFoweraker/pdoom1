# ASCII Compliance Fix

This commit addresses a minor ASCII compliance violation in commit eed10b3 where a checkmark emoji ([EMOJI]) was used in the commit message.

## Fixed Issues:
- Commit message contained non-ASCII characters: [U+00E2], [U+0153], ...
- These were part of the [EMOJI] emoji in "Status: [EMOJI] READY"

## ASCII Policy:
All commit messages must use ASCII characters only for cross-platform compatibility and repository consistency.

## Resolution:
Future commits will use ASCII alternatives like:
- [READY] instead of [EMOJI]
- [SUCCESS] instead of [EMOJI] 
- [COMPLETE] instead of [EMOJI]
- [OK] instead of [EMOJI]

## Status:
[COMPLIANT] - ASCII policy now properly enforced
