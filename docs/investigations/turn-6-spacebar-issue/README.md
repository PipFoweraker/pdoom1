## Key Findings Summary

### Issue Scope
- **GUI-Specific**: Core game logic works correctly through Turn 6
- **Event Handling**: Problem in pygame event loop processing (main.py)
- **Reproducible**: Consistently occurs at Turn 6 in GUI mode

### Root Cause Hypotheses
1. **Dialog State Corruption**: Turn 6 triggers that set dialog flags incorrectly
2. **Event Processing Race**: TurnManager + legacy systems create conflicts
3. **Keybinding System Failure**: Dynamic import issues during event processing

### Technical Debt Identified
- Event loop monolith (3200+ lines in main.py)
- Dual processing systems (TurnManager + legacy)
- Complex dialog blocking conditions lacking coordination
- Testing gaps in GUI event handling

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Issue Resolution (24-48 hours)
- [ ] Enhanced diagnostics implementation
- [ ] Turn 6 event/milestone analysis
- [ ] Dialog state monitoring system
- [ ] Reproduction test case creation
- [ ] Emergency recovery enhancement

### Phase 2: Architecture Refactoring (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Spacebar handler extraction from main.py
- [ ] Dialog state management unification
- [ ] TurnManager integration completion
- [ ] Input system architecture improvement

### Phase 3: Testing Implementation (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] GUI event test framework development
- [ ] Turn progression validation (turns 0-100)
- [ ] State management testing suite
- [ ] Regression prevention measures

### Phase 4: Optimization (3-4 weeks)
- [ ] Event loop performance analysis
- [ ] Error handling robustness enhancement
- [ ] Documentation and developer experience
- [ ] Final validation and deployment

## Next Session Preparation

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Start Phase 1**: Begin enhanced diagnostics implementation
2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Automated test for Turn 6 spacebar issue
3. **Emergency Recovery**: Implement expanded Ctrl+E functionality
4. **Begin Refactoring**: Extract spacebar handler from main.py

### Files to Focus On
- `main.py` (lines 2290-2700): Event loop and spacebar handling
- `src/core/game_state.py`: Turn processing and dialog state management
- `src/core/turn_manager.py`: Turn processing state management
- `tests/`: Create new GUI event testing framework

### Development Environment Setup
- Ensure pygame environment is ready for GUI debugging
- Prepare diagnostic logging configuration
- Set up test framework for GUI event simulation
- Configure dev mode (F10) for enhanced diagnostics

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Success (48 hours)
- [ ] Root cause identified with precise reproduction steps
- [ ] Enhanced diagnostics provide clear failure visibility
- [ ] Temporary workaround available (enhanced Ctrl+E)
- [ ] Automated reproduction test validates fix effectiveness

### Implementation Success (4 weeks)
- [ ] Turn 6 spacebar issue permanently resolved
- [ ] Event handling architecture significantly improved
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for GUI input handling
- [ ] Technical debt in input/event systems eliminated
