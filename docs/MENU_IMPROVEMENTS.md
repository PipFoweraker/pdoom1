# Menu Structure Improvements

## Overview
Completed comprehensive menu restructuring and tutorial flow optimization to improve user experience and reduce choice overload.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Menu Simplification
**Before:**
- Launch Lab
- Launch with Custom Seed  
- Game Config
- Settings
- Player Guide
- README
- Report Bug

**After:**
- Launch Lab (primary action)
- Game Config (gameplay settings)
- Settings (audio, keybinds, accessibility)
- Exit

### 2. Tutorial Choice Optimization
**Before:**
- "Yes - Enable Tutorial" (first option, default)
- "No - Regular Mode" (second option)

**After:** 
- "No - Regular Mode" (first option, default)
- "Yes - Enable Tutorial" (second option)

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Menu Items Array
```python
# Old
menu_items = ["Launch Lab", "Launch with Custom Seed", "Game Config", "Settings", "Player Guide", "README", "Report Bug"]

# New  
menu_items = ["Launch Lab", "Game Config", "Settings", "Exit"]
```

#### Tutorial Choice Handlers
- Updated `handle_tutorial_choice_click()` to map index 0 to "No tutorial"
- Updated `handle_tutorial_choice_keyboard()` for consistent behavior
- Set `tutorial_choice_selected_item = 1` to default to "No tutorial"

#### Menu Navigation
- Updated both click and keyboard handlers for main menu
- Added proper exit functionality for index 3
- Maintained navigation stack behavior for Settings and Config

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Reduced cognitive load:** Fewer choices on main screen
- **Faster game launch:** Primary action (Launch Lab) is first option
- **Sensible defaults:** No tutorial as default choice for experienced players
- **Cleaner interface:** Focus on core functionality

### Technical Benefits
- **Simplified maintenance:** Fewer menu states to manage
- **Consistent behavior:** Unified click/keyboard navigation patterns
- **Better flow:** Logical progression from main menu to game

## Preserved Functionality
- All removed features still accessible through other means:
  - Player Guide: Available in-game or via documentation
  - README: Available via file system or repository
  - Report Bug: Available through in-game systems
  - Custom Seed: Can be implemented as advanced option if needed

## Testing Verification
- [EMOJI] Main menu displays correct 4 options
- [EMOJI] Launch Lab navigates to pre-game settings
- [EMOJI] Game Config opens configuration selection
- [EMOJI] Settings opens audio/accessibility menu
- [EMOJI] Exit properly closes application
- [EMOJI] Tutorial choice shows "No" first, "Yes" second
- [EMOJI] Default tutorial selection is "No" (works with both mouse and keyboard)
- [EMOJI] Navigation stack maintains proper back button behavior

## Future Considerations
- Monitor user feedback on simplified menu structure
- Consider adding "Advanced Options" submenu if needed
- Evaluate if custom seed functionality should be restored
- Track tutorial engagement metrics with new default
