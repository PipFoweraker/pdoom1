Quick Integration Guide for Enhanced Settings System
==================================================

This guide shows how to integrate the enhanced settings system with minimal risk.

STEP 1: IMMEDIATE FIX (ALREADY DONE)
===================================
The custom seed functionality is now fixed. These changes have been applied:

1. main.py line 89: Fixed menu_items to match UI
2. main.py handle_menu_click(): Fixed to handle 'Launch with Custom Seed' 
3. main.py handle_menu_keyboard(): Updated for new menu structure
4. ui.py and src/ui/menus.py: Aligned menu items

TEST: Run the game and click 'Launch with Custom Seed' - it should now work!

STEP 2: ENHANCED SETTINGS (OPTIONAL)
===================================
To enable the full enhanced settings system:

1. In main.py, find the line:
   elif i == 2:  # Settings
       current_state = 'sounds_menu'

2. Replace with:
   elif i == 2:  # Settings  
       from src.ui.settings_integration import settings_state
       settings_state.enter_settings()
       current_state = 'settings_main'

3. Add new state handling in the rendering section:
   elif current_state == 'settings_main':
       from src.ui.settings_integration import settings_state
       settings_state.draw_current_menu(screen, SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H)

4. Add mouse handling:
   elif current_state == 'settings_main':
       from src.ui.settings_integration import settings_state
       result = settings_state.handle_main_settings_click((mx, my), SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H)
       if result:
           current_state = result

STEP 3: GAME CONFIG MENU (OPTIONAL)
==================================
To enable custom game configurations:

1. Add to main.py states:
   elif current_state == 'game_config_menu':
       from src.ui.settings_integration import settings_state
       settings_state.draw_current_menu(screen, SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H)

2. Add game config mouse handling:
   elif current_state == 'game_config_menu':
       from src.ui.settings_integration import settings_state
       result = settings_state.handle_game_config_click((mx, my), SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H)
       if result:
           current_state = result

TESTING THE ENHANCED SYSTEM
===========================
Run the demo to see the full system:
   python demo_settings.py

FILES CREATED
=============
Core System:
- src/ui/enhanced_settings.py
- src/ui/settings_integration.py  
- src/services/game_config_manager.py
- src/services/seed_manager.py

Demo & Documentation:
- demo_settings.py
- SETTINGS_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md

ROLLBACK PLAN
=============
If any issues arise, simply revert these main.py changes:
1. Line 89: menu_items back to original
2. handle_menu_click() function back to original
3. handle_menu_keyboard() function back to original

The enhanced system files can remain - they don't affect existing functionality.

COMMUNITY FEATURES READY
========================
Once integrated, players can:
- Create custom game configurations
- Share config + seed combinations  
- Use templates (Standard, Hardcore, Sandbox, Speedrun)
- Export/import community challenges

IMMEDIATE BENEFIT
================
The custom seed functionality is fixed RIGHT NOW. Players can:
1. Click 'Launch with Custom Seed'
2. Enter any seed or leave blank for weekly seed
3. Start the game with their chosen seed

This was the core issue and it's resolved!
