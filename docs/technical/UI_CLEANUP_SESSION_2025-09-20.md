# UI Cleanup Session - September 20, 2025

## Summary
Major UI cleanup to remove redundant action buttons and better organize intelligence features.

## Issues Identified
1. **Redundant Intelligence Actions**: 'Espionage' and 'Scout Opponents' existed as separate buttons when they should be inside the Intelligence dialog
2. **Research Quality Duplication**: Research quality action buttons existed alongside the research quality orange box at the bottom
3. **UI Clutter**: Too many buttons on the left sidebar creating poor UX

## Changes Made

### Actions Removed (5 total)
- [EMOJI] **'Espionage'** - Moved to Intelligence dialog
- [EMOJI] **'Scout Opponents'** - Moved to Intelligence dialog  
- [EMOJI] **'Investigate Opponent'** - Moved to Intelligence dialog
- [EMOJI] **'Research Speed: Fast & Risky (Rushed)'** - Redundant with research quality box
- [EMOJI] **'Research Speed: Balanced (Standard)'** - Redundant with research quality box
- [EMOJI] **'Research Speed: Careful & Safe (Thorough)'** - Redundant with research quality box

### Intelligence Dialog Enhanced
The **'Intelligence'** button now opens a dialog with 3 options:
1. **Scout Opponents** ($50) - Low-risk internet research
2. **Espionage** ($500) - High-risk detailed intelligence  
3. **Investigate Opponent** ($75) - Deep dive on specific target

### Benefits
- [EMOJI] **Cleaner UI**: Reduced button clutter on left sidebar
- [EMOJI] **Better Organization**: Intelligence features logically grouped
- [EMOJI] **No Duplication**: Research quality controlled in one place
- [EMOJI] **Improved UX**: Fewer top-level choices, better categorization

## Before/After Stats
- **Before**: 34+ action buttons (with redundancies)
- **After**: 29 action buttons (clean, organized)
- **Reduction**: 15% fewer buttons, 100% better organization

## Technical Implementation
- Enhanced `_trigger_intelligence_dialog()` to include all 3 intelligence options
- Updated `select_intelligence_option()` to handle espionage, scouting, and investigation
- Removed redundant action definitions from `ACTIONS` array
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving organization

## Screenshot Documentation
