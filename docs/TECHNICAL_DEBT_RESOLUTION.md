**Implementation:**
- `src/services/verbose_logging.py` - Multi-level logging with JSON export
- Action, resource, and RNG event tracking
- Configurable detail levels (MINIMAL/STANDARD/VERBOSE/DEBUG)
- 14 unit tests ensuring reliability

**Key Features:**
- Human-readable and machine-parseable logs
- Privacy-first design (opt-in only)
- Structured data for analysis tools
- Automatic file management and cleanup

### 🏆 Privacy-Respecting Leaderboards
**Problem:** No competitive infrastructure without compromising privacy  
**Solution:** Pseudonymous leaderboard system with user control

**Implementation:**
- `src/services/leaderboard.py` - Complete leaderboard infrastructure
- Privacy manager with pseudonym generation
- Local-first with optional cloud sync
- 11 unit tests covering privacy scenarios

**Key Features:**
- Pseudonymous participation only
- User-controlled data sharing
- Local storage with optional sync
- Competitive integrity without surveillance
