- **Call History Tracking**: Complete audit trail for debugging and analysis
- **Lazy Evaluation**: RNG calls only made when needed for performance

### Integration Patterns Established
```python
# Pattern 1: Simple random replacement
random.random() → get_rng().random(f"context_turn_{self.turn}")

# Pattern 2: Context-specific calls  
random.randint(1, 10) → get_rng().randint(1, 10, f"specific_context_turn_{self.turn}")

# Pattern 3: Employee-specific contexts
random.choice(items) → get_rng().choice(items, f"employee_{blob_id}_turn_{self.turn}")
```

### Community Features Usage
```python
# Enable hyper-verbose debugging
from src.services.deterministic_rng import enable_community_debug
enable_community_debug()

# Create memorable challenge seed
from src.services.deterministic_rng import create_challenge_seed
seed = create_challenge_seed("Tournament Final")  # → "PDOOM-SILVER-DAWN-4567"

# Export challenge for community
from src.services.deterministic_rng import get_challenge_export
challenge_data = get_challenge_export()
# Contains: seed, call_history, verification_signature, debug_info
```
