# Turn Sequencing Fix - Summary

## Problem Fixed
Events were triggering AFTER actions were executed, causing:
- Events appearing after player had already committed to actions
- Poor player agency - couldn't respond to events that should influence decisions  
- Confusing game flow where events seemed to 'interrupt' turn processing

## Solution Implemented  
**Quick Fix (Phase 1)**: Moved `trigger_events()` to the **beginning** of `end_turn()` method

### Changes Made:
1. **In `src/core/game_state.py`**:
   - Moved `self.trigger_events()` to very start of turn processing
   - Added check for pending popup events that block turn completion
   - Removed duplicate `trigger_events()` call from later in the method
   - Added explanatory comments

### New Turn Flow:
```
end_turn() - NEW SEQUENCE:
1. Start turn processing
2. trigger_events() <- EVENTS NOW HAPPEN FIRST!
3. Check for pending popups (blocks turn if needed)
4. Clear messages and prepare turn
5. Execute selected actions  
6. Process staff maintenance
7. Process opponent actions
8. Check milestones
9. Handle deferred events
10. Increment turn and reset action points
```

## Benefits:
[EMOJI] **Events appear before action commitment** - Players see all information before deciding  
[EMOJI] **Proper game flow** - Events guide player decisions rather than interrupting them  
[EMOJI] **Better player agency** - Can respond to events with full action point availability  
[EMOJI] **Backward compatible** - Doesn't break existing functionality  

## Testing Needed:
- Test that events appear at proper time during turn cycle
- Verify popup events block turn advancement correctly  
- Ensure no duplicate events or missing events
- Check that action selection works properly after events

## Next Steps:
This is a **Phase 1 Quick Fix**. For complete architectural improvement:
- Implement proper turn state management ('events', 'actions', 'processing')
- Add UI indicators for turn phases
- Enhance event system for better turn integration
- See `issues/turn-sequencing-architecture.md` for full implementation plan
