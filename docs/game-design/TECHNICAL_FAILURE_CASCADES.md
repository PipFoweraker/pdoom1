# Technical Failure Cascades Implementation Guide (Issue #193)

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Technical Failure Cascades system implemented in P(Doom) v0.3.0.

## Overview

The Technical Failure Cascades system models how technical failures in AI safety organizations can trigger additional failures, creating realistic domino effects that organizations must manage. It explores the tension between transparency/learning and cover-up/reputation protection.

## Core Concepts

### Failure Types
The system models 7 types of technical failures:

1. **Research Setback** - Critical bugs, validation failures, experimental protocol violations
2. **Security Breach** - Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, insider threats
3. **System Crash** - Infrastructure failures, memory leaks, network outages
4. **Data Loss** - Irretrievable research data, backup failures, storage corruption
5. **Safety Incident** - AI system dangerous behavior, alignment failures, safety bypasses
6. **Infrastructure Failure** - Power grid issues, cooling failures, physical security breaches
7. **Communication Breakdown** - Information silos, coordination failures, management disconnects

### Cascade Mechanics

**Failure Cascade Process:**
1. **Initial Failure** - A technical failure occurs based on technical debt, game state, and random chance
2. **Cascade Check** - Each failure has a chance to trigger additional failures (cascade chance)
3. **Response Choice** - Player chooses how to respond (transparency, investigation, cover-up)
4. **Propagation** - If not contained, additional failures occur over 1-3 turns
5. **Resolution** - Cascade eventually resolves with long-term consequences

**Near-Miss System:**
- Events that almost become failures but are caught in time
- Provide learning opportunities without immediate penalties
- Build organizational resilience through lessons learned
- Improved by monitoring systems and incident response capabilities

### Response Framework

**Transparency Approach:**
- Full public disclosure of incidents
- Immediate reputation cost but long-term trust building
- Maximum learning from failures (2x lessons learned)
- Builds 'transparency reputation' leading to future benefits

**Investigation Approach:**
- Internal review with limited public disclosure
- Moderate reputation cost and investigation expenses
- Standard learning from failures
- Balanced middle-ground approach

**Cover-Up Approach:**
- Minimal public disclosure, classify incidents
- No immediate reputation loss but accumulates 'cover-up debt'
- Cover-up costs and increased future failure risks
- Risk of exposure events with severe consequences

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Classes

**TechnicalFailureCascades** - Main system manager
- Tracks active cascades and failure history
- Manages near-misses and lessons learned
- Handles prevention system upgrades
- Integrates with existing game systems

**FailureEvent** - Individual failure representation
- Failure type, severity, description
- Immediate resource impacts
- Cascade chance and potential targets
- Turn tracking for temporal analysis

**CascadeState** - Active cascade tracking
- Initiating failure and subsequent failures
- Transparency level and containment status
- Turn duration and resolution tracking

### Prevention Systems

**Three-Tier Prevention Architecture:**

1. **Incident Response** (Cost: $30k per level, max 5)
   - Rapid response protocols and containment procedures
   - Reduces failure severity and improves cascade containment
   - Required for effective crisis management

2. **Monitoring Systems** (Cost: $40k per level, max 5)
   - Early warning systems and anomaly detection
   - Increases near-miss detection (prevents failures)
   - Provides advance warning of developing issues

3. **Communication Protocols** (Cost: $25k per level, max 5)
   - Cross-team coordination and crisis communication
   - Prevents communication breakdown failures
   - Improves organizational response coordination

### Game Integration

**Turn Processing Integration:**
- Cascade checks occur during `end_turn()` processing
- Integrated after economic cycles but before event resolution
- Respects existing turn sequencing and event systems

**Technical Debt Integration:**
- High technical debt increases failure frequency and severity
- Debt levels influence failure type selection weights
- Safety audits reduce both technical debt and failure risks

**Event System Integration:**
- 4 new cascade-specific events with trigger conditions
- Uses enhanced event system for complex player choices
- Integrates with existing event framework and deferred events

## Technical Implementation Details

### Failure Probability Calculation

```python
# Base failure check during turn processing
if hasattr(gs, 'technical_debt'):
    debt_accident_chance = gs.technical_debt.get_accident_chance()
    cascade_trigger_chance = debt_accident_chance * 0.3
    
    if random.random() < cascade_trigger_chance:
        trigger_potential_cascade()
```

### Near-Miss vs Failure Decision

```python
# Near-miss chance calculation
near_miss_chance = 0.4 + (monitoring_systems * 0.1)

if random.random() < near_miss_chance:
    trigger_near_miss(failure)  # Learning opportunity
else:
    trigger_actual_failure(failure)  # Real consequences
```

### Cascade Propagation Logic

```python
# Cascade continuation check (per turn for active cascades)
if not cascade.is_contained and cascade.total_turns <= 3:
    if random.random() < 0.4:  # 40% chance per turn
        add_subsequent_failure(cascade)
```

### Prevention Effectiveness

```python
# Incident response effectiveness on cascade containment
containment_chance = 0.5 + (incident_response_level * 0.1)
# Level 0: 50%, Level 5: 100% containment chance

# Monitoring systems effectiveness on near-miss detection  
near_miss_chance = 0.4 + (monitoring_systems * 0.1)
# Level 0: 40%, Level 5: 90% near-miss chance
```

```

## Balancing and Game Design

### Resource Costs
- **Prevention systems** require significant investment (total $285k for max levels)
- **Safety audits** provide immediate debt reduction but require regular reinvestment
- **Opportunity costs** force trade-offs with research, staff, and other priorities

### Risk-Reward Balance
- **Transparency** provides long-term benefits but immediate reputation costs
- **Cover-ups** provide short-term protection but accumulate future risks
- **Prevention** reduces failure frequency but requires upfront investment

### Scaling Considerations
- **Early game:** Focus on basic prevention, manage limited resources
- **Mid game:** Balance prevention investment with organizational growth
- **Late game:** Achieve prevention mastery, leverage transparency reputation

### Player Learning Objectives
- **Failure inevitability:** Even well-managed organizations experience failures
- **Response importance:** How you handle failures matters more than preventing all of them
- **Transparency value:** Short-term reputation costs create long-term institutional benefits
- **Prevention investment:** Proactive investment prevents reactive crisis management

## Future Extensions

### Potential Enhancements
- **Cross-organizational cascades:** Failures affecting competitor organizations
- **Regulatory responses:** Government oversight triggered by failure patterns
- **Media dynamics:** Public perception and media coverage of incidents
- **International incidents:** Global-scale cascade events requiring coordination

### Integration Opportunities
- **Economic cycles:** Failure impacts during different economic phases
- **Opponent systems:** Competitor failure cascades affecting global doom
- **Research quality:** Deeper integration with quality vs speed trade-offs
- **Staff systems:** Individual researcher involvement in incident response

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Complexity
- **O(1) cascade checks** per turn with bounded cascade duration
- **Minimal memory overhead** for tracking active cascades and history
- **Efficient event integration** using existing game event framework

### Memory Management
- **Bounded failure history** prevents unbounded growth
- **Cascade auto-resolution** ensures active cascades don't accumulate indefinitely
- **Event cleanup** properly removes resolved cascades from active tracking

This implementation provides a robust foundation for exploring technical failure cascades in AI safety organizations while maintaining the game's performance, balance, and educational objectives.
