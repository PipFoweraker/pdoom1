2. **Parallel ASCII Compliance Fix** - Quick wins with standards script
3. **Focus on UI Navigation** - Essential for user onboarding

### Success Metrics
- **Test Suite**: Reduce failures from 53 to <20 (target <2.5% failure rate)
- **Gameplay**: Enable 100% game completion without crashes
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-1 second startup time
- **Compatibility**: 100% ASCII compliance across all files

### Resource Allocation
- **Development Time**: ~40-50 hours across 3-4 weeks
- **Testing Time**: ~10-15 hours for comprehensive validation
- **Documentation**: ~8-10 hours for proper documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH Risk Areas
1. **Action System Changes** - Core game mechanics, high regression risk
2. **UI Navigation Fixes** - Complex pygame interactions, integration challenges
3. **Game State Management** - Critical for save/load functionality

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Extensive Testing**: Run full test suite after each major change
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Small, focused commits with validation
3. **Backup Branches**: Maintain stable branches for rollback capability
4. **User Testing**: Early feedback on critical UI changes

## Long-term Vision (Post-Stabilization)

### Advanced Features (Months 2-3)
