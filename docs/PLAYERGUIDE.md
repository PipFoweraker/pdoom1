## Bootstrap Economics & Cash Flow Management

**P(Doom) v0.4.0+ features a realistic bootstrap AI safety lab economic model:**

### Weekly Staff Costs
- **First Employee**: $600/week (~$31k annually) - Junior research assistant level
- **Additional Staff**: $800/week each (~$42k annually) - Growing overhead costs
- **5-Person Team**: ~$4,000/week total maintenance costs
- **Strategic Pressure**: Creates real 2-3 week funding planning cycles

### Fundraising Strategy (NEW!)
Access **Fundraising Options** action to choose from 4 strategic approaches:
- **Fundraise Small**: $5-10k (covers 2-3 weeks, low risk)
- **Fundraise Big**: $15-25k (provides 4-6 weeks runway, higher risk)  
- **Borrow Money**: Immediate cash with future debt obligations
- **Alternative Funding**: Grants/partnerships (unlocked with milestones)

### Zero-Cost Operations
Bootstrap approach means many actions are now free:
- **Hiring**: No signing bonuses for nonprofit (staff costs come from weekly maintenance)
- **Scout Opponents**: Free internet research and public information gathering
- **Media/PR**: Self-funded social media and blog outreach  
- **Research**: Reduced from $40k to $3k per week (still significant for small labs)

### Moore's Law Advantage
- **Compute Costs**: Decrease 2% each week (realistic technology improvement)
- **Strategic Planning**: Early compute purchases become cheaper over time
- **Scaling Benefits**: Late-game projects benefit from accumulated cost reductions

---

## Milestone Events & Employee Management

As your organization grows, you'll encounter special milestone events:

### Manager System (9+ Employees)
- **Trigger**: Unlocks at 9 employees, hire managers for $90 (1.5x normal cost)
- **Rules**: Employees beyond 9 need management or become unproductive
- **Visual**: Managers = green blobs, unmanaged = red slash overlay

### Board Compliance (>$10K Spending)  
- **Trigger**: Spend >$10K without Accounting Software
- **Effect**: Installs board members, audit risk, "Search" action unlocked
- **Prevention**: Purchase Accounting Software ($500) beforehand

*For detailed milestone mechanics, see [Milestone-Driven Special Events](#milestone-driven-special-events) below.*

### Employee Types
- **Regular Employees** (blue): Your standard workforce
- **Managers** (green with crown): Supervise clusters of employees  
- **Board Members** (purple with briefcase): Ensure regulatory compliance

### Employee Productive Actions
Each employee performs specialized productive actions when requirements are met, providing passive bonuses appropriate to their role:

- **Research Staff**: Focus on literature review, data collection, and advanced algorithm development
- **Security Engineers**: Conduct security auditing, threat modeling, and incident response
- **Operations Staff**: Optimize infrastructure, monitor systems, and maintain documentation  
- **Administrative Staff**: Streamline processes, manage stakeholder relations, and ensure compliance
- **Managers**: Handle strategic planning, team coordination, and resource allocation

**Key Mechanics:**
- Employees automatically perform their selected productive action each game tick (no cost)
- Actions require sufficient compute, reputation, or organizational resources to activate
- Active actions provide multiplicative effectiveness bonuses (typically +6% to +18%)
- Failed requirements result in reduced effectiveness until conditions improve
- Actions can be changed at any time (future UI feature planned)

### Cash Flow UI
- **Unlocked by**: Purchasing the Accounting Software upgrade ($500)
- **Features**: 
  - Real-time balance change indicators (green for income, red for expenses)

## Visual Feedback & UI Transitions

The game provides rich visual feedback to help you understand how your actions affect the game state:

### Upgrade Transitions
When you purchase upgrades, they don't just disappear - they smoothly animate from their button location to become icons at the top right:

- **Smooth Animation**: Upgrades follow a curved arc path over 1 second
- **Visual Trail**: Green trail points create motion blur effect during the transition  
- **Glow Highlight**: The destination icon location pulses with a green glow
- **Clear Feedback**: You can see exactly where your purchased upgrade ends up

### Other Visual Feedback
- **Action Points**: AP counter glows yellow when spent, showing strategic impact
- **Cash Flow**: Balance changes appear when accounting software is purchased
- **Employee Animations**: Staff blobs animate in from the side when hired
- **UI State Changes**: All UI state changes include visual transitions for clarity

### Why Visual Feedback Matters
These animations aren't just decoration - they serve important gameplay functions:
- **Clarity**: See where UI elements go when they change state
- **Feedback**: Immediate confirmation of successful actions
- **Understanding**: Visual cues help you learn the interface faster
- **Satisfaction**: Smooth animations make interactions feel responsive

## Action Points Strategy

The Action Points (AP) system creates strategic depth through resource management and staff scaling.

### How Action Points Work
- **Base AP**: You start with 3 Action Points per turn
- **Staff Scaling**: Regular staff provide +0.5 AP each (hire more for higher capacity)
- **Admin Assistants**: Specialized staff providing +1.0 AP each (expensive but powerful)
- **Turn Reset**: AP automatically resets to calculated maximum each turn
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Your max AP grows as you hire staff (3 + staff*0.5 + admin*1.0)

### Staff Types & AP Bonuses
- **üìã Admin Assistants**: High-cost specialists (+1.0 AP each) for maximum action capacity
- **üî¨ Research Staff**: Enable delegation of research actions with reduced effectiveness
- **‚öôÔ∏è Operations Staff**: Enable delegation of operational tasks, often with lower AP costs
- **üë• Regular Staff**: Provide base +0.5 AP bonus and general productivity

### Delegation System
**Research Delegation:**
- Safety Research and Governance Research can be delegated to research staff
- Requires 2+ research staff, maintains same AP cost, but 80% effectiveness
- Good for managing multiple priorities when you have the staff

**Operations Delegation:**
- Buy Compute can be delegated to operations staff for routine procurement
- Requires 1+ operations staff, costs 0 AP when delegated, full effectiveness
- Automatically delegated when beneficial (lower AP cost)

### Visual Indicators
- **AP Counter**: Displayed as "AP: 2/3" in the top resource bar
- **Glow Effect**: AP counter glows yellow when Action Points are spent
- **Button States**: Action buttons gray out when you lack sufficient AP
- **Cost Display**: Each action shows both money cost and AP cost


### Strategic Tips
üéØ **Early Game (3-4 AP)**: Focus on essential actions like fundraising and safety research  
üìà **Growth Phase (5-8 AP)**: Invest in staff hiring to expand action capacity  
‚ö° **Late Game (9+ AP)**: Leverage delegation and specialized staff for complex operations  
üíº **Admin Investment**: Admin assistants are expensive but provide the highest AP return  
üîÑ **Delegation Planning**: Build research/ops staff for long-term delegation benefits  

### Staff Investment Guide
- **Cost-Effective**: Regular staff (60$ for +0.5 AP = 120$ per AP)
- **High-Impact**: Admin assistants (80$ for +1.0 AP = 80$ per AP) 
- **Specialized**: Research/Ops staff (70$ for delegation capabilities)
- **Balanced Approach**: Mix of regular staff, 1-2 admins, and specialists based on strategy
