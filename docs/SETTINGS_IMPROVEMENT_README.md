This directory contains screenshots demonstrating the improvement to the "generic loading screen" (pre-game settings screen) in P(Doom).

## Improvements Made

### Visual Design
- **Themed Background**: Replaced plain grey with subtle bureaucratic grid pattern
- **Enhanced Typography**: Better font hierarchy with themed titles ("LABORATORY CONFIGURATION")
- **Color Scheme**: Cohesive blue/grey theme matching P(Doom)'s bureaucracy aesthetic
- **Visual Icons**: Small indicators for each setting type (research, audio, visual, safety)

### Functionality
- **Working Settings**: Replaced "DUMMY" placeholders with functional settings that actually cycle
- **Realistic Values**: Settings now use appropriate ranges and terminology
- **Interactive Controls**: Click buttons or use arrow keys to cycle through options

### Thematic Integration
- **Bureaucratic Language**: "Research Intensity" instead of "Difficulty", "Audio Alerts Volume" instead of "Sound Volume"
- **Laboratory Theme**: "LABORATORY CONFIGURATION" and "INITIALIZE LABORATORY" buttons
- **Safety Protocols**: Added institutional safety level setting
- **Instructions**: Enhanced with emoji and bureaucratic terminology

### Technical Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced with left/right arrow support for cycling
- **Mouse Support**: Click any setting to cycle through values
- **Value Persistence**: Settings maintain their state throughout the session
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid/dummy values

The enhanced screen transforms a generic placeholder into an engaging, themed interface that fits seamlessly with P(Doom)'s satirical bureaucracy game experience.
