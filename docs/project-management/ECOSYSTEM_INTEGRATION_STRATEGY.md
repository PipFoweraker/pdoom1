## Technical Integration Architecture

### Data Flow Design
```
pdoom1 (Core Game) --> pdoom1-website (Community/API) --> pdoom-data (Analytics/Research)
                         ^                                      ^
                         |                                      |
                    Version Sync                         Scenario/Data Export
                    Documentation                        Research Pipeline
                    Tournament Results                   Behavior Analysis
```

### API Interface Specifications

#### Game Session Export Format (Proposed)
```json
{
  'session_id': 'uuid4',
  'version': '0.8.0',
  'seed': 'deterministic_seed',
  'duration_turns': 50,
  'player_decisions': [
    {
      'turn': 1,
      'actions_selected': ['Grow Community', 'Buy Compute'],
      'resources_before': {'money': 100000, 'staff': 5, 'doom': 25},
      'resources_after': {'money': 95000, 'staff': 6, 'doom': 24}
    }
  ],
  'final_outcome': {
    'victory': true,
    'score': 85,
    'doom_final': 15,
    'turns_survived': 50
  },
