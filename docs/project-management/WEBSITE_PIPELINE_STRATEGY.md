# Website Pipeline Strategy: Development-to-Community Bridge

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for creating automated pipelines that connect P(Doom) game development activities to the pdoom1-website community platform. The goal is to build seamless infrastructure that automatically publishes development progress, milestones, and insights to engage the community and provide transparency into the development process.

## Infrastructure Analysis

### Current State Assessment

```

### Pipeline Architecture Design

## Phase 1: Basic Content Sync Pipeline

### 1.1 Dev Blog Auto-Sync Workflow

**Objective**: Automatically sync dev-blog entries to website when new entries are created

**Implementation**: GitHub Actions workflow in pdoom1 repository

```yaml
# .github/workflows/sync-dev-blog.yml
name: Sync Dev Blog to Website
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'dev-blog/entries/**'
      - 'dev-blog/index.json'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync-blog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout pdoom1
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Checkout website
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: PipFoweraker/pdoom1-website
          token: ${{ secrets.WEBSITE_SYNC_TOKEN }}
          path: website
          
      - name: Sync dev blog entries
        run: |
          # Copy all entries to website blog directory
          cp -r dev-blog/entries/* website/public/blog/
          
          # Copy index for navigation
          cp dev-blog/index.json website/public/blog/
          
      - name: Commit and push to website
        working-directory: website
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Dev Blog Sync Bot'
          git config user.email 'dev@pdoom.net'
          git add public/blog/
          git commit -m 'Auto-sync: Dev blog entries from pdoom1' || exit 0
          git push
```

### 1.2 Version Release Pipeline

**Objective**: Automatically publish release notes and version announcements

**Trigger**: Git tags matching `v*.*.*` pattern

**Implementation**: Enhanced release workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release-to-website.yml
name: Publish Release to Website
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create release blog post
        run: |
          # Generate release blog post from CHANGELOG
          # Post to website/public/blog/releases/
          # Update website navigation
```
