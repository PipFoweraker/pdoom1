# PDoom Contributor Recognition Program

## Overview

PDoom values community contributions! Whether you're reporting bugs, suggesting features, or helping test the game, we want to recognize your efforts. The **Office Cat System** is our way of immortalizing your contributions in the game itself.

## How It Works

### 1. Submit Your Contribution

You can contribute in several ways:

#### In-Game Bug Reporter
- Press **F8** in-game to open the bug reporter
- Fill out the form with your bug report, feature request, or feedback
- Optionally include your name for attribution
- Your report is saved locally and will be processed into a GitHub issue

#### GitHub Issues
- Report bugs or suggest features directly on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PipFoweraker/pdoom1/issues)
- Use the `community-submission` label

#### Community Forum
- Visit [pdoom.net/forum](https://pdoom.net/forum) (coming soon)
- Submit feedback in the Bugs & Development section

### 2. Get Recognized

When your contribution is approved:

1. **You'll be added to our Contributor Database** (via Airtable CRM)
2. **Submit your cat photo** (we'll guide you through this!)
3. **Your cat becomes an Office Cat** in the game
4. **You're listed in the Credits** screen

### 3. Your Cat in the Game

Your office cat will:

- Appear randomly for players who have unlocked office cats
- Display your name and contribution type when hovered
- Transform based on the doom meter level (5 variants from happy to corrupted!)
- Be part of PDoom's visual identity forever

## The Office Cat System

### Doom-Level Variants

Your cat image will be processed into 5 variants that visually change as the game's doom level increases:

| Doom Level | Variant | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 0-20% | Happy | Content office cat, normal environment |
| 21-40% | Concerned | Slightly worried expression |
| 41-60% | Worried | More distressed, environmental corruption begins |
| 61-80% | Distressed | Heavily corrupted environment, cat clearly stressed |
| 81-100% | Corrupted | Full doom aesthetic (like Doom Guy's bloodied face at low health) |

### Cat Image Requirements

- **Format**: Any common image format (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- **Subject**: A photo of your cat (or other pet - we're flexible!)
- **Quality**: High resolution preferred (we'll resize to 256x256px)
- **Rights**: You must own the rights to the image

Don't worry about creating the variants - we handle that! You just provide one photo, and our image processing pipeline (or manual editing) creates the doom-progression.

## Contribution Types

Your contribution is categorized and displayed in-game:

### Bug Reports
- Report reproducible bugs
- Help identify game-breaking issues

## Privacy & Opt-In

Participation is **completely optional** and **privacy-first**:

- You can opt out of the office cat program at any time
- All contribution data is handled according to our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md)

## FAQ

### Can I contribute anonymously?
Yes! Uncheck the "Include attribution" box in the bug reporter. We still value your contribution!

### Can I submit multiple contributions?
Absolutely! The more you contribute, the more recognized you'll be in the credits.

### What if I don't have a cat?
We're flexible - dogs, other pets, or even creative alternatives are welcome! The "office cat" is a fun term, but we celebrate all contributors.

### How long does it take to get my cat added?
Processing times vary, but we aim to include approved contributors in the next major release (typically monthly updates).

### Can I update my cat image later?
Yes! Contact us if you'd like to update your submission.

### What if my contribution isn't accepted?
We review all contributions thoughtfully. If a suggestion doesn't fit the current roadmap, we'll explain why and may revisit it in the future.

## Recognition Tiers
