# P(Doom) Documentation Organization

This document provides an overview of the documentation structure following the major monolith refactoring completed in September 2025.

## Current Architecture Status

### Modular Architecture Achievement
- **558 lines extracted** from game_state.py monolith (111.6% of 500-line goal)
- **6 focused modules created** with clean separation of concerns
- **game_state.py reduced** from 6,240 to 5,682 lines (10.9% reduction)

### New Module Structure
```
src/core/
├── game_constants.py      # Core defaults and configuration constants
├── ui_utils.py           # UI positioning and collision detection utilities  
├── verbose_logging.py    # RPG-style message formatting (160 lines)
├── employee_management.py # Employee blob lifecycle management (38 lines)
├── dialog_systems.py     # Dialog state and option management (153 lines)
└── utility_functions.py  # Validation and processing utilities (171 lines)
```

## Quick Reference for Developers

### Getting Started
1. Read `README.md` for installation
2. Review `DEVELOPERGUIDE.md` for development setup
3. Check `architecture/` for system architecture understanding

### Contributing
1. Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines
2. Review `architecture/REFACTORING_PRIORITIES.md` for current priorities
3. Use `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` for release procedures

### Configuration
- See `CONFIG_SYSTEM.md` for configuration system details
- Check `src/core/game_constants.py` for default values

## Recent Major Changes (September 2025)

### Monolith Refactoring Completion
- Successfully extracted 6 focused modules from game_state.py
- Achieved 111.6% of ambitious 500-line extraction goal
- Maintained zero functional regressions
- All modules properly typed with comprehensive annotations

### Documentation Reorganization
- Archived completed monolith refactoring documentation
- Organized session handoffs and development records
- Created focused architecture documentation section
- Established clear navigation structure for new contributors

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates Needed
- Update `DEVELOPERGUIDE.md` when new modules are added
- Maintain `architecture/` documentation as system evolves
- Archive completed development sessions regularly
- Update version-specific documentation in `releases/`

### Archive Policy
