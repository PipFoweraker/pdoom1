# P(Doom) Pre Alpha Bug Sweep Plan - September 11, 2025

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the P(Doom) codebase, this plan outlines a strategic 2-day bug resolution roadmap to achieve early alpha readiness. We've identified **critical stability issues**, **high-impact fixes**, and **accessibility enhancements** that will transform the game from development state to public-ready alpha.

**Current Bug Status**: 10 open bug issues (#211-261) + **6 newly discovered bugs** with **3 critical defects** found in codebase analysis

## Priority Classification System

**Expected Day 2 Outcome**: Polished alpha with robust error handling and accessibility foundation

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Error-Prone Code Areas Identified

1. **Event Handling (ui.py)**
   ```python
   # PROBLEM: Direct pygame event access without validation
   for event in pygame.event.get():
       if event.type == pygame.MOUSEWHEEL:  # <- Can crash here
   
   # SOLUTION: Add bounds checking and error wrapping
   def safe_handle_mousewheel(event, game_state):
       try:
           # Validate event has required attributes
           if hasattr(event, 'y') and hasattr(event, 'x'):
               # Safe processing
       except (AttributeError, IndexError) as e:
           # Log and continue gracefully
   ```

2. **Rectangle Operations (ui.py)**
   - Already partially fixed per docs/UI_CRASH_FIX.md
   - Need verification of all `_in_rect()` calls

3. **Configuration Loading (Multiple Files)**
   - Extensive error handling already in place
   - Need validation of edge cases in test failures

4. **ðŸ”´ NEW CRITICAL: Duplicate Return Statements (game_state.py:2091-2097)**
   ```python
   # PROBLEM: Unreachable code and logic errors
   return None
   
   return None  # <- This never executes
   
   except Exception as e:  # <- This never executes
   
   # SOLUTION: Remove duplicate return statements
   ```

5. **ðŸ”´ NEW CRITICAL: Array Bounds in GameClock (game_clock.py:130,196)**
   ```python
   # PROBLEM: Direct array access without bounds checking
   month_abbrev = self.MONTH_ABBREVS[self.current_date.month - 1]  # Can crash if month invalid
   
   # SOLUTION: Add bounds validation
   month_index = max(0, min(11, self.current_date.month - 1))
   month_abbrev = self.MONTH_ABBREVS[month_index]
   ```

6. **ðŸŸ  NEW HIGH: List Modification During Iteration**
   ```python
   # PROBLEM: Modifying list while iterating (race condition)
   for action in self.delayed_actions[:]:  # Good - uses slice copy
       # But other locations may not use slice copy
   
   # PROBLEM in magical orb stats:
   if stat_to_scout in stats_to_scout:
       stats_to_scout.remove(stat_to_scout)  # Modifying list during iteration
   
   # SOLUTION: Use separate tracking or reverse iteration
   ```

### Testing Strategy

**Validation Requirements for Alpha Release:**
- âœ… 100% test pass rate (currently 4 failing tests)
- âœ… No crashes on basic game interaction (15-minute manual test)
- âœ… Tutorial system works end-to-end
- âœ… Save/load functionality works correctly
- âœ… Sound system works without crashes

**Automated Testing Approach:**
```bash
# Full validation suite
python -m unittest discover tests -v  # Must pass 100%
python -c "from src.core.game_state import GameState; GameState('alpha-test')"
python main.py  # 5-minute smoke test
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### HIGH RISK: Mouse Wheel Crash (Issue #261)
- **Impact**: Complete game crash on wheel scroll
- **Mitigation**: Priority #1 fix, comprehensive event handling rewrite
- **Fallback**: Disable mouse wheel if fix proves complex

### MEDIUM RISK: Test Infrastructure  
- **Impact**: 4 failing tests indicate unstable foundation
- **Mitigation**: Fix test expectations, not underlying logic (tests likely outdated)
- **Fallback**: Temporarily skip broken tests with TODO comments

### LOW RISK: UI Polish Items
- **Impact**: Minor user experience issues
- **Mitigation**: Simple fixes, well-documented problems
- **Fallback**: Known issues list for alpha release notes

## Success Metrics for Alpha Readiness

### Objective Criteria (Must Achieve)
1. **Stability**: Zero crashes in 30-minute play session
2. **Functionality**: All core game loops work (tutorial â†’ game â†’ save â†’ load)
3. **Testing**: 100% test suite pass rate
4. **Performance**: Game launches in <5 seconds, maintains 30+ FPS
5. **Accessibility**: Basic keyboard navigation works for critical functions

### Quality Indicators (Nice to Achieve)  
1. **Polish**: Professional feel in UI interactions
2. **Audio**: Sound effects work reliably across platforms
3. **Configuration**: Settings persist correctly between sessions
4. **Documentation**: Known issues documented for users
