# P(Doom) v0.10.0 Release Notes
**"Global Leaderboards" - Web Export System & Competition Ready**

Released: October 9, 2025

## >---

## >> Impact: Global Leaderboards Now Possible

This release **completely unblocks global leaderboards** by providing the missing bridge between P(Doom)1's local leaderboard data and the pdoom1-website's global display system. The website repository was specifically waiting for this exact functionality.

**Players can now compete globally while maintaining privacy through anonymous lab identities!** Feature: Global Leaderboards Unlocked

Version 0.10.0 introduces the **Web Export System**, a comprehensive infrastructure that enables global leaderboards and cross-player competition through integration with the [pdoom1-website](https://github.com/PipFoweraker/pdoom1-website) repository.

### >> What This Enables

- **Global Competition**: Players can now participate in worldwide leaderboards
- **Privacy-Respecting Rankings**: Anonymous competition with configurable privacy controls
- **Website Integration**: Direct compatibility with pdoom1-website leaderboard system
- **Real Data Ready**: 31 entries across 20 leaderboards ready for export

## >> New Features

### Web Export System (`tools/web_export/`)
Complete infrastructure for exporting leaderboard data in website-compatible format:

- **`export_leaderboards.py`** - Main export functionality with CLI interface
- **`api_format.py`** - Converts internal format to web API JSON structure  
- **`privacy_filter.py`** - Configurable anonymization and privacy controls
- **`WEB_EXPORT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### CLI Interface (`src/leaderboard/`)
Standardized command-line interface matching website requirements:

```bash
# Export all leaderboards for website
python -m src.leaderboard export --format web --output ./web_export/

# Export specific seed with privacy filtering  
python -m src.leaderboard export --seed party-demo-seed --privacy-filter

# List available leaderboards
python -m src.leaderboard list

# Check system status
python -m src.leaderboard status
```

### Privacy Features
- **Anonymous Lab Names**: Deterministic generation ensures consistent identity across exports
- **Configurable Levels**: None/Standard/Strict anonymization options
- **Data Minimization**: Only competitive metrics exported, sensitive data rounded
- **Privacy Manifest**: Documents all filtering applied to exported data

## >> Technical Specifications

### Export Format
Produces JSON files matching pdoom1-website API specification:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "generated": "2025-10-09T21:37:14Z",
    "game_version": "v0.10.0",
    "total_players": 4,
    "export_source": "game-repository",
    "privacy_filtered": true
  },
  "seed": "competitive-seed",
  "economic_model": "Bootstrap_v0.4.1", 
  "entries": [
    {
      "score": 25,
      "player_name": "Atlas Computing",
      "date": "2025-10-09T16:01:32Z",
      "final_money": 150000,
      "final_staff": 8,
      "final_reputation": 75.0,
      "research_papers_published": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Privacy Protection
- **Lab Name Pool**: 20 realistic AI lab names for anonymization
- **Deterministic Mapping**: Same player gets same anonymous name across exports
- **Sensitive Rounding**: Financial data rounded to preserve competitive utility while protecting privacy
- **UUID Handling**: Can hash entry UUIDs in strict mode while preserving uniqueness

## >> Integration Workflow

1. **Game Side**: Players play games, leaderboard data accumulates locally
2. **Export**: Run `python -m src.leaderboard export --format web --output ./web_export/`
3. **Transfer**: Copy exported JSON files to website repository
4. **Website Side**: pdoom1-website displays leaderboards using API endpoints

## >> Current Status

- **20 Leaderboards Available** with real game data
- **31 Total Entries** across multiple competitive seeds
- **Full Privacy Protection** with standard anonymization enabled
- **Production Ready** with comprehensive error handling and validation

## >> For Players

- **Competitive Play**: Your scores can now be part of global leaderboards
- **Privacy Assured**: Player names are anonymized as lab names (e.g., "Quantum Leap", "Atlas Computing")
- **Fair Competition**: Seed-specific leaderboards ensure fair comparison
- **Opt-in System**: Leaderboard participation respects existing privacy settings

## >> For Developers

- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Extensible Format**: Easy to add new export formats or privacy levels
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in validation and format checking
- **Documentation**: Complete setup and integration guides included

## >> Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a purely additive feature that doesn't affect existing gameplay or APIs.

## >> Bug Fixes

- Improved error handling for corrupted leaderboard files
- Fixed datetime serialization in JSON export
- Enhanced privacy filter robustness

## >> Documentation Updates

- **WEB_EXPORT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md**: Complete web export system documentation
- **Updated README.md**: New version info and web export feature highlights
- **Enhanced CHANGELOG.md**: Detailed v0.10.0 feature documentation

## >> What's Next
