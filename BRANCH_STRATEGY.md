# Branch Organization Strategy for PipFoweraker/pdoom1

## Executive Summary

**Date:** August 5, 2025  
**Analysis Scope:** All open issues without existing PRs  
**Total Issues Analyzed:** 30 open issues (excluding 3 with existing PRs: #86, #87, #88)  
**Recommended Branches:** 5 thematic branches

## Branch Strategy Overview

After analyzing all 30 open issues without PRs, we recommend organizing them into **5 thematic branches** that balance development complexity, feature coherence, and team productivity:

### üé® Branch 1: `feature/ui-ux-fixes`
**Priority:** HIGH (contains critical bugs)  
**Issues:** 15 issues | **Complexity Score:** 21  
**Focus:** User interface improvements, bug fixes, and user experience polish

**Key Issues:**
- #82: Options menu crash (CRITICAL BUG)
- #74: Startup errors and crash fixes (CRITICAL BUG) 
- #85: Keyboard shortcuts display
- #16: Loading screen implementation
- #18: Windowing and tiling system
- #38: End game menu overhaul
- Plus 9 additional UI/UX improvements

**Rationale:** This branch contains the most critical stability issues that directly affect user experience. Should be prioritized for immediate development.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Branch 2: `feature/core-game-systems`
**Priority:** HIGH (foundational features)  
**Issues:** 9 issues | **Complexity Score:** 30  
**Focus:** Core gameplay mechanics, action points, events, and game systems

**Key Issues:**
- #56: Action Points System with Staff Delegation (MAJOR FEATURE)
- #42: Event System Overhaul (MAJOR FEATURE)
- #40: Game Config File System 
- #37: Game Flow Improvements
- #14: Compute as game resource
- #15: Multiple opponent labs
- Plus 3 additional core system features

**Rationale:** These are foundational systems that other features depend on. High complexity but essential for game architecture.

### üéµ Branch 3: `feature/audio-endgame-experience`
**Priority:** MEDIUM (polish features)  
**Issues:** 3 issues | **Complexity Score:** 4  
**Focus:** Audio feedback, sound effects, and end-game experience

**Key Issues:**
- #66: 'Bazinga!' sound on paper completion
- #51: Money spent sound effects
- #55: Graceful end game modes

**Rationale:** Polish features that enhance player experience but aren't blocking other development.

### üì¶ Branch 4: `feature/release-infrastructure`
**Priority:** HIGH (release critical)  
**Issues:** 2 issues | **Complexity Score:** 2  
**Focus:** Release preparation, versioning, and infrastructure

**Key Issues:**
- #46: 0.1.0 Release Readiness Checklist
- #44: Public-facing versioning system

**Rationale:** Essential for project maturity and public release readiness.

### üë• Branch 5: `feature/employee-advanced-systems`
**Priority:** LOW (future enhancement)  
**Issues:** 1 issue | **Complexity Score:** 1  
**Focus:** Advanced employee management and hiring complexity

**Key Issues:**
- #41: Employee Subtypes and Player Agency

**Rationale:** Advanced feature that can be implemented after core systems are stable.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Stability (Weeks 1-2)
1. **`feature/ui-ux-fixes`** - Address critical bugs and crashes
2. **`feature/release-infrastructure`** - Set up versioning and release processes

### Phase 2: Core Foundation (Weeks 3-6)  
3. **`feature/core-game-systems`** - Implement foundational game mechanics

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Weeks 7-8)
4. **`feature/audio-endgame-experience`** - Add polish and player experience features
5. **`feature/employee-advanced-systems`** - Advanced gameplay features

## Branch Creation Commands

```bash
# Branch 1: UI/UX Fixes (PRIORITY 1)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/ui-ux-fixes
git push -u origin feature/ui-ux-fixes

# Branch 2: Core Game Systems (PRIORITY 2) 
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/core-game-systems
git push -u origin feature/core-game-systems

# Branch 3: Audio & End Game (PRIORITY 4)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/audio-endgame-experience
git push -u origin feature/audio-endgame-experience

# Branch 4: Release Infrastructure (PRIORITY 3)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/release-infrastructure
git push -u origin feature/release-infrastructure

# Branch 5: Employee Advanced (PRIORITY 5)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/employee-advanced-systems
git push -u origin feature/employee-advanced-systems
```

## Issue Assignment Strategy

### GitHub Project Management
1. Create a GitHub Project board with 5 columns (one per branch)
2. Move issues to appropriate branch columns
3. Create milestones for each branch to track progress
4. Use labels to indicate priority within each branch

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with `feature/ui-ux-fixes`** - Contains critical bugs that block user adoption
2. **Parallel development** of `feature/release-infrastructure` - Small scope, high impact
3. **Follow with `feature/core-game-systems`** - Foundational features for other development
4. **Polish phases** with remaining branches as core systems stabilize

## Success Metrics

### Branch Completion Criteria
- **UI/UX Fixes:** All critical bugs resolved, UI polish implemented
- **Core Systems:** Action points and event systems fully functional
- **Audio/End Game:** Sound feedback implemented, graceful game endings
- **Release Infrastructure:** Version 0.1.0 ready for public release
- **Employee Systems:** Advanced hiring mechanics implemented

### Quality Gates
- All branches must pass existing test suite
- New features must include appropriate test coverage
- Documentation must be updated for public-facing changes
- Manual testing required for UI/UX changes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Branch isolation:** Keep branches focused to avoid merge conflicts
- **Dependency management:** Core systems branch may block others
- **Testing coordination:** Ensure comprehensive integration testing

### Process Risks  
- **Over-engineering:** Start simple, iterate based on feedback
- **Scope creep:** Stick to defined issue boundaries per branch
- **Resource allocation:** Prioritize based on user impact and technical dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Create all 5 branches** using the provided commands
2. **Assign issues to branches** in GitHub project management
3. **Set up branch policies** (require PR reviews, CI checks)
4. **Begin development** with `feature/ui-ux-fixes` (highest priority)
5. **Regular progress reviews** to adjust priorities as needed
