Loading Screen for P(Doom) - TODO: Implementation

This module will contain the loading screen implementation.
Currently a stub to be implemented in future PRs.

Future responsibilities:
- Render loading progress with thematic styling
- Display loading status messages and progress bars
- Provide accessibility-friendly loading feedback
- Integrate with existing loading screen drawing

TODO: Move existing draw_loading_screen logic from ui.py to this screen class.
