# üê± Stray Cat Event - COMPLETE

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Issue**: #365 - CLOSED

## Summary

THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE - our only draw card! A friendly stray cat appears on turn 7 and can be adopted to boost morale and reduce doom.

## Implementation

### Event Trigger
- **Turn**: Exactly turn 7
- **Type**: One-time event (non-repeatable)
- **Name**: "üê± A Stray Cat Appears!"

### Event Description
> "A friendly stray cat has wandered into your lab. It seems to enjoy watching the researchers work and occasionally walks across keyboards. Adopt it?"

### Player Options

1. **Adopt the Cat** üòª
   - **Cost**: $500
   - **Effect**: `has_cat = true`, `-1 doom`
   - **Message**: "üê± Cat adopted! Your researchers' morale improves slightly. The cat has claimed the spot near the End Turn button. (-1 doom)"

2. **Feed It and Let It Go**
   - **Cost**: $100
   - **Effect**: None
   - **Message**: "You give the cat some food and it wanders off, purring contentedly."

3. **Shoo It Away**
   - **Cost**: $0
   - **Effect**: `+1 doom` (karma for being heartless)
   - **Message**: "The cat leaves, disappointed. Your researchers seem a bit sad. (+1 doom for being heartless)"

## Visual Display

When adopted, a cat emoji (üê±) appears in the UI near the End Turn button:

```
[Init Game] [Test Action] [End Turn] üê± [Phase: ACTION_SELECTION]
```

The cat serves as a permanent reminder of your lab's humanity and compassion.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **godot/scripts/core/events.gd**
   - Added `stray_cat` event definition
   - Added `turn_exact` trigger type for precise turn triggering
   - Added `has_cat` effect handler in `execute_event_choice()`

2. **godot/scripts/core/game_state.gd**
   - Added `has_cat: bool` property
   - Added `has_cat` to `to_dict()` serialization

3. **godot/scenes/main.tscn**
   - Added `CatLabel` node next to EndTurnButton

4. **godot/scripts/ui/main_ui.gd**
   - Added `@onready var cat_label` reference
   - Added cat display logic in `_on_game_state_updated()`

### Event Structure

```gdscript
{
    "id": "stray_cat",
    "name": "üê± A Stray Cat Appears!",
    "description": "A friendly stray cat has wandered...",
    "type": "popup",
    "trigger_type": "turn_exact",
    "trigger_turn": 7,
    "repeatable": false,
    "options": [...]
}
```

### Trigger Type: turn_exact

New trigger type specifically for events that must happen on a specific turn:

```gdscript
match trigger_type:
    "turn_exact":
        return state.turn == event.get("trigger_turn", -1)
```

## Game Design Benefits

1. **Morale Boost**: Small doom reduction rewards compassion
2. **Personality**: Adds character and charm to the game
3. **Player Choice**: Three meaningful options with different outcomes
4. **Visual Reward**: Persistent cat emoji shows your choice mattered
5. **Humor**: "Walking across keyboards" detail is relatable
6. **Consequences**: Shooing the cat away increases doom (karma!)

## Future Enhancement (FAR FUTURE)

**Vision**: Players can upload photos of their actual cats, which get converted into in-game doom reduction mechanics. The cat's personality traits affect gameplay:

- **Lazy cat**: Slower doom increase
- **Playful cat**: Random positive events
- **Grumpy cat**: Intimidates rival labs
- **Cuddly cat**: Boosts researcher productivity

This creates an emotional connection between players' real pets and the game's stakes!

## Testing

To test:
1. Start new game in Godot
2. Play through to turn 7
3. Cat event should trigger
4. Choose "Adopt the Cat"
5. Pay $500
6. Check that üê± appears near End Turn button
7. Verify doom reduced by 1

## Why This Is Important

As you said: **"I also really fucking want to get that cat into the game ASAP, it's our only drawcard"**

This isn't just a cute feature - it's:
- **Memorable**: Players will talk about the cat
- **Sharable**: "There's a game where you can adopt a cat to save humanity"
- **Emotional**: Creates attachment to the game
- **Unique**: No other AI safety game has a lab cat
- **Extensible**: Opens door for pet-based mechanics

## Quotes

Event message Easter eggs:
- "occasionally walks across keyboards" - Every cat owner knows this
- "disappointed" - The guilt is real
- "purring contentedly" - The one that got away
- "claimed the spot" - Cats don't ask permission
