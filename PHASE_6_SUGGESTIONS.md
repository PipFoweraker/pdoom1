# Phase 6 Suggestions - UI Polish & Playtesting

Based on Phase 5 implementation, here are prioritized improvement suggestions:

## üéØ High Priority - Core UX

### 1. Employee Productivity Visual Feedback
**Problem**: Players won't immediately understand why employees are unproductive

**Solution**: Add visual indicators in main UI
```gdscript
# Show for each employee type:
- ‚úÖ Productive (green) vs ‚ùå Unproductive (red)
- Reason for unproductivity: "Needs Compute" or "Needs Manager"
- Hover tooltips explaining the system
```

**Example UI Mock**:
```
Safety Researchers: 5  [3‚úÖ / 2‚ùå]
  ‚îî‚îÄ 2 employees need compute
Managers: 0  [‚ö†Ô∏è HIRE MANAGER! 5 employees unmanaged]
```

### 2. Rival Lab Progress Display
**Problem**: Rivals act every turn but player doesn't see their status

**Solution**: Add "Rival Labs" panel showing:
- Name, funding, reputation
- Recent actions (scrolling log)
- Safety vs capability progress
- Aggression indicator (color-coded)

**Visual**: Progress bars comparing your lab vs rivals

### 3. Action Affordability Highlighting
**Problem**: 18 actions is a lot to scan through

**Solution**:
- Green: Can afford
- Yellow: Can almost afford (within 20%)
- Red: Cannot afford
- Grey out unavailable actions
- Show exact requirements on hover

### 4. Event Notification System
**Problem**: Events in message log easy to miss

**Solution**:
- Modal popup for events (like Python version)
- Event icon/sound effect
- History panel showing past event choices
- "New Event!" badge on UI

### 5. Turn Summary Screen
**Problem**: A lot happens each turn, easy to lose track

**Solution**: After turn end, show summary:
- Research generated: +X from Y productive employees
- Doom changes: Base +1.0, Caps +0.5, Rivals +2.3, Safety -0.9 = Net +2.9
- Rival actions: "CapabiliCorp researched capabilities, DeepSafety published paper"
- Warnings: "5 unproductive employees" with red highlight

## üé® Medium Priority - Visual Polish

### 6. Resource Warning Thresholds
**Solution**: Color-code resources when low
- Money < $50k: Yellow

### 8. Keyboard Shortcuts
**Solution**: Hotkeys for common actions

- 50-75: Orange (danger)
- 75-100: Red (critical!)
- Animated pulse when doom > 75

### 10. Employee Cost Breakdown

## üí≠ Design Philosophy Notes

**Core Principle**: Information should be **visible** and **actionable**

**Bad**: "You have 5 unproductive employees" (in scrolling message log)
**Good**: Red warning badge, tooltip explaining why, button to fix

**Bad**: Rivals act silently in background
**Good**: Rival actions visible, progress bars, threat indicators

**Bad**: 18 actions in flat list
**Good**: Categorized, color-coded by affordability, hotkeys

---

## üéä Phase 6 Goal

Transform Phase 5's solid mechanics into **polished, intuitive gameplay** that:
- ‚úÖ Communicates system state clearly
- ‚úÖ Guides new players without hand-holding
- ‚úÖ Rewards skilled play with depth
- ‚úÖ Feels responsive and rewarding

**Target**: First playthrough success rate 60%+ (up from estimated 30% with current bare UI)

---

## üìù Quick Wins (Implement First)

If you only have time for 5 things, do these:

1. **Unproductive employee warnings** - Critical for avoiding doom spiral
2. **Action affordability colors** - Makes action selection 10x faster
3. **Rival lab display** - Shows why doom is changing
4. **Turn summary** - Helps players learn from mistakes
5. **Resource warnings** - Prevents surprise bankruptcies

These 5 improvements would make the game **playable and fun** even without the rest!
