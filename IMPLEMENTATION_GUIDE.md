## Development Workflow

### Per-Branch Process
1. **Create branch** (commands above)
2. **Assign issues** in GitHub project board
3. **Create milestone** for the branch
4. **Begin with highest priority issue** in that branch
5. **Regular PR reviews** back to main
6. **Integration testing** before merging

### Quality Gates
- All new code must pass existing tests
- Add tests for new functionality  
- Update documentation for user-facing changes
- Manual testing for UI changes

## GitHub Project Setup

```bash
# After creating branches, set up GitHub project management:
# 1. Go to repository Settings > Projects
# 2. Create new project: "Issue Branch Organization"
# 3. Add 5 columns named after each branch
# 4. Move issues to appropriate columns
# 5. Create milestones for each branch
```

## Success Criteria

### By Branch Completion:
- **UI/UX:** No critical crashes, polished interface
- **Core Systems:** Action points and events fully functional
- **Audio/End Game:** Sound feedback, graceful endings
- **Release:** Version 0.1.0 public-ready
- **Employee:** Advanced hiring implemented

### Overall Success:
- All 30 issues resolved across 5 branches
- No more than 5 active branches at any time
- Clear progress tracking via GitHub projects
- Improved code organization and maintainability
