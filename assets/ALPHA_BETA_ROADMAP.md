## Contingency Planning

### Schedule Risks
**If Week 1-2 runs long**: Delay alpha launch by 1 week, maintain beta timeline  
**If delegation system blocked**: Release alpha without delegation, move to beta  
**If RNG system complex**: Implement basic deterministic mode, enhance in post-release

### Quality Risks  
**If critical bugs discovered**: Extend testing phases, delay release as needed  
**If performance issues**: Optimize during polish phase, maintain quality bar  
**If balance issues**: Adjust through configuration, leverage logging data

### Success Acceleration
**If ahead of schedule**: Begin polish phase early, add stretch features  
**If community highly engaged**: Accelerate beta timeline, add requested features  
**If logging reveals insights**: Implement balance changes ahead of schedule
