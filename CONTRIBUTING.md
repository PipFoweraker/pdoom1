# Copilot and Automation Instructions

- Always install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) before running code or tests.
- The `main` branch is stable and does not need runtime bug checks for every PR.
- Always include `import pygame` at the start of any Python file that uses pygame.
- Only update documentation files (README.md, PLAYERGUIDE.md) if there are user-facing changes.
- When updating DEVELOPERGUIDE.md, it's okay to be verbose and include a table of contents.

Cheers!
